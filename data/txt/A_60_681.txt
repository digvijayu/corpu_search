	I.	Introduction


1.	The surge in peacekeeping operations in early 2004 continued through the reporting period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The total of 17 peacekeeping missions remained the same, including two missions (UNTSO and UNMOGIP) that are funded by the regular budget. The composition of the missions changed during the period in that the peacekeeping operation in Timor-Leste (UNMISET) was closed in May 2005 and a new mission was established in the Sudan (UNMIS) in March 2005. In addition, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations provides a full range of administrative and logistical support services to 13 special political missions, 11 of which were managed by the Department of Political Affairs, with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations having the substantive lead in 2 (UNAMA and UNOTIL). The three peacekeeping operations that were established in the months of April, May and June 2004 — ONUB, UNOCI and MINUSTAH — became fully operational during the 2004/05 reporting period. With these three missions at their full operational capacity and the establishment of a new mission in the Sudan, the overall peacekeeping budget level increased considerably, from $2.7 billion in 2003/04 to $4.4 billion in 2004/05. This trend was only slightly offset by the downsizing of the mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). The overall level of peacekeeping activity has had an impact on the level of support and backstopping provided by all departments at United Nations Headquarters. 
2.	The number of troops and other personnel deployed in the missions during the period also increased. The peak number of troops deployed in 2003/04 was approximately 49,000. This number increased to 58,843 in 2004/05. At the same time the number of United Nations police officers reached 6,765, compared to 5,251 in the previous reporting period. The peak number of military observers increased moderately from 2,022 in 2003/04 to 2,177 in the current reporting period. At the aggregate level, these trends resulted in a maximum number of 67,150 police and military personnel being deployed during 2004/05, a 19 per cent increase from the 2003/04 level of 56,261. The level of civilian staff in the missions also increased by 16 per cent, from 10,545 in 2003/04 to a peak level of 12,236 in the 2004/05 reporting period. 
3.	The impact of these changes in the volume of peacekeeping in general and in the number of personnel to be supported has been that some of the activities and projects, which had been planned for in the 2004/05 budget, were not completed. All departments supporting peacekeeping operations have had to focus their resources on deploying and backstopping the newly established and expanding missions. Consequently, the non-implementation of certain activities has resulted in slightly lower budget implementation compared with the previous period and underexpenditures in posts, official travel, facilities and infrastructure and information technology. These factors will be dealt with in greater detail in the variance analyses.
4.	During the period under review, the Secretariat has continued to improve its performance in the management of peacekeeping operations. The achievements of this work in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other departments are described in the context of the results-based frameworks in the present report. The actual performance of the offices and departments concerned is presented against the baselines that were established in the 2004/05 budget (A/58/715). The extent to which progress has been made against the expected accomplishments is presented in the results-based frameworks, which compare actual indicators of achievement with planned indicators of achievement. Information on planned and actual outputs is provided in the addendum to the present report. 
5.	In the present report, the Secretariat has continued recent years’ efforts to make the frameworks more concrete, streamlined and reader-friendly. In light of the need to reprioritize resources in response to the surge in peacekeeping, particular efforts have been made to explain, where appropriate, the impact on the actual outputs compared to the planned outputs of the approved budget (A/58/715).
6.	The Secretariat’s efforts to rationalize and optimize the management of peacekeeping are reflected in its ability to cope with the increased workload within the level of resources approved prior to the surge in peacekeeping. For a number of outputs, activities and invested resources were planned on the assumption that support was to be provided to 11 ongoing peacekeeping missions and 9 special political missions by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, while actual completed outputs have increased owing to the addition of four missions (UNMIS, ONUB, UNOCI and MINUSTAH) and 13 special political missions. This development has been particularly important for support provided by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, as evident in the addendum to the present report. In the Civilian Police Division, for instance, the streamlining of the management of rosters for potential candidates for judicial and corrections officers enabled staff to handle the increased number of candidates to be registered. The same point can be made with reference to the management of requests for referrals in the Investigations Division of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. In the Department of Safety and Security, a change in the training concept whereby trainers travelled to missions instead of trainees travelling to New York, led to actual savings compared to the approved budget for official travel. In the Department of Management, significantly higher outputs than budgeted were achieved in a number of different areas, e.g. in terms of the number of budget and performance reports prepared, the number of foreign exchange purchases and fund movements, the number of payments to Member States and the number of medical examinations.


	II.	Resource performance


7.	The resources approved for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 were $121,610,300, from which expenditures amounted to $118,025,500, resulting in an unencumbered balance of $3,584,800, or a budget implementation rate of 97.2 per cent, which is slightly lower than the rate of 99.2 per cent in the previous reporting period. Table 1 below presents a summary of resource performance by category during the current reporting period. Table 2 shows other income and adjustments.
8.	The unencumbered balance is attributable primarily to underexpenditure in respect of post resources, while balances were also left unspent under official travel, facilities and infrastructure, communications, information technology, medical, and other supplies, services and equipment.
9.	The General Assembly, in section XI of its resolution 59/276, authorized the establishment of a new consolidated Department of Safety and Security effective 
1 January 2005, which incorporated UNSECOORD and the Security and Safety Service. Consequently, the report on the performance of these two entities in the 2004/05 reporting period has also been consolidated and will be presented in section H below, on the Department of Safety and Security.

	4.	Analysis of variances1


VarianceGeneral temporary assistance$72.653.5%

10.	The unspent balance of $72,600 is attributable to lower than expected requirements for replacements during maternity leave and extended sick leave.

VarianceOfficial travel$117.24.7%

11.	The primary reasons for the unspent balance are: (a) the activities of two planning, liaison and advisory teams from the Military Division were redirected and conducted during the start-up phase instead of after the establishment of MINUSTAH; hence, costs were charged to the Mission budget; (b) the cancellation of the participation of one staff exchange partner administered by the Executive Office of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The travel was cancelled because operational requirements did not allow the release of the staff member to participate in the programme.

VarianceFacilities and infrastructure$38.022.7%

12.	The underexpenditure of $38,000 was incurred owing to the delay in the recording of actual charges for the rental of office equipment. 

VarianceInformation technology$620.813.5%

13.	The underexpenditure is due primarily to the transfer of responsibility for maintenance of the Galaxy Data Centre to the Information Technology Services Division in the Department of Management. The transfer of responsibility is due to the rationalization and consolidation of the work processes between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Management in accordance with the organizational information and communications technology strategy. Funds approved for this purpose were consequently made available to the Division, thus resulting in savings reflected in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. In addition, this unspent balance is due to the delays experienced in the procurement of some information technology equipment.

VarianceOther services, supplies and equipment$46.45.6%

14.	The unspent balance is due to the cancellation of some training activities in the Office of Mission Support. Efforts were directed to refocus its activities temporarily to support the establishment of new peacekeeping missions. In addition, some workshops were conducted in-house instead of at external training facilities.

21.	The unspent balance of $1,752,300 resulted from lower than budgeted staff costs relating to the resident auditors in the peacekeeping missions. This was because provisions for the resident auditors were budgeted at New York standard staff cost, while a number of these posts were encumbered by mission appointees (300-series contracts) whose actual salaries were lower. As evident in the 2005/06 budget report, the staff costs for the resident auditor posts in the missions have been budgeted on the basis of the respective mission’s average staff costs. This practice will continue in the budget for the 2006/07 period.
22.	In addition, actual costs were lower because of higher than expected vacancy rates for General Service staff. This was due to difficulties with recruitment owing to the freeze on external recruitment of General Service staff in effect during the period.

VarianceGeneral temporary assistance$13.228.2%

VarianceFacilities and infrastructure$4.719.7%

25.	The unspent balance is attributable to actual costs of equipment, furniture and office supplies being slightly lower than the budgeted standard costs.

VarianceCommunications$13.130.3%

26.	The unutilized balance of $13,100 resulted from the absorption by the United Nations Office at Vienna of the communications charges of the Office of Internal Oversight Services regional investigation hub in Vienna and from lower than expected actual communications costs in the Office of Internal Oversight Services regional investigation hub in Nairobi. 

VarianceOther services, supplies and equipment($4.3)(6.2%)

27.	Expenditures were higher than expected because of additional requirements for training for staff members in the Internal Audit Division. Additional training activities included 14 classes aimed at the enhancement of audit skills and an online “skills training package”.

VariancePosts$918.05.5%

34.	The unspent balance of $918,000 is attributable primarily to higher than expected vacancy rates among professional posts owing to delayed recruitment of staff for a number of new posts.

VarianceGeneral temporary assistance($102.6)(12.5%)

35.	The additional requirement of $102,600 is related primarily to the transfer of responsibility for the maintenance of the Galaxy data centre from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to the Information Technology Services Division, for which the Department made funds available to the Division for hiring temporary assistance. Higher than expected requirements for general temporary assistance in the Operational Services Division in order to process a larger than planned number of recruitment actions also contributed to the overexpenditure.

VarianceConsultants($55.7)(9.8%)

36.	The additional requirement of $55,700 is due primarily to the hiring of a consultant to undertake a comprehensive study of the relocation of procurement and information technology functions to UNLB, as requested by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in its report (A/58/796).


VarianceOfficial travel$319.747.3%

37.	The unutilized balance of $319,700 is attributable to cancellations and postponements of visits to missions by the Procurement Division, the Operational Services Division and the Peacekeeping Finance Division. The increase in workload related to the surge in peacekeeping operations necessitated the review of priorities, resulting in the cancellation and/or postponement of planned travel to the missions. In the Division for Organizational Development, the injury of a staff member led to training-related travel being postponed or undertaken by a consultant, thus leaving unspent approved funds under official travel.

VarianceFacilities and Infrastructure$131.52.1%

38.	The Office of Internal Oversight Services regional investigation hubs in Vienna and Nairobi were provided rent-free accommodation within the United Nations premises. This resulted in the unspent balance of $131,500. Hence, no provision will be made for rental of premises in Vienna and Nairobi for Office of Internal Oversight Services regional investigation hubs in the 2006/07 support account.

VarianceInformation technology($331.3)(63.7%)

39.	The additional requirement of $331,300 is due to costs associated with the transfer of responsibility for the maintenance of the Galaxy data centre from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to the Information Technology Services Division.

VarianceMedical$8.08.0%

40.	The costs of the actual requirements for such medical supplies as vaccines and medical kits for mission personnel were slightly lower than budgeted. 

VarianceOther services, supplies and equipment$29.414.0%

41.	The unspent balance of $29,400 relates primarily to the postponement of some planned training activities in the Division for Organizational Development. This was due to the need to reprioritize resources in order to focus on activities in support of the surge in peacekeeping operations, that is, primarily, advice on the application of human resources rules and regulations and on the administration of justice.
