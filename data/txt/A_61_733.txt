	I.	Introduction


1.	The number of active peacekeeping missions during the reporting period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 was 17, including two missions (UNTSO and UNMOGIP) funded from the regular budget. During the reporting period the Secretariat completed the full operational deployment for UNMIS, which was authorized in March 2005. During the period the Security Council adopted significant adjustments to existing mandates by increasing military and police personnel in MONUC, MINUSTAH and UNOCI and reducing the force level in UNMEE and ONUB. In the same period the final withdrawal of UNAMSIL was completed and the follow-up mission, UNIOSIL, was established.
2.	In addition to peacekeeping operations, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations continues to provide a full range of administrative and logistical support services to 16 special political missions, 11 of which were managed by the Department of Political Affairs. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations also has the substantive lead in three missions (UNAMA, UNOTIL and UNIOSIL). With UNMIS at its full operational capacity, the overall peacekeeping budget increased considerably, from $2.7 billion in 2003/04 to $4.4 billion in 2004/05 and $5.0 billion in 2005/06. The overall level of peacekeeping activity has had an impact on the level of support and backstopping provided by all departments at United Nations Headquarters. 
3.	The number of troops and other personnel deployed in the missions during the period also increased. The peak number of troops deployed in 2004/05 was approximately 58,843, which increased to 63,099 in 2005/06. At the same time, the peak number of United Nations police officers reached 7,552, compared with 6,766 in the previous reporting period. The peak number of military observers increased moderately, from 2,177 in 2004/05 to 2,731 in the 2005/06 reporting period. At the aggregate level, these trends resulted in a maximum of 73,382 police and military personnel being deployed during 2005/06, an 8 per cent increase from the 2004/05 level of 67,786. The level of civilian staff in the peacekeeping missions also increased by 8 per cent, from 12,236 in 2004/05 to a peak level of 13,255 in the 2005/06 reporting period. In addition, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations provided administrative support to 2,393 civilian staff in political and peacebuilding missions during 2005/06, an increase of 52 per cent from the previous period, in which administrative support was provided to 1,574 staff.
4.	During the period under review, the Secretariat has continued to improve its performance in the management of peacekeeping operations. The achievements of such work in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other departments are described in the context of the results-based frameworks in the present report. The actual performance of the offices and departments concerned is presented against the baselines that were established in the 2005/06 budget (A/59/730). The extent to which progress has been made against the expected accomplishments is presented in the results-based frameworks, which compare actual indicators of achievement with planned indicators of achievement. Information on planned and actual outputs is provided in the addendum to the present report. 
5.	In the present report, the Secretariat has continued recent years’ efforts to make the frameworks more concrete, streamlined and reader-friendly. Wherever appropriate because of the need to reprioritize resources in response to unplanned priorities, particular efforts have been made to explain the impact on the actual outputs being compared with the planned outputs of the approved budget (A/59/730).


	II.	Resource performance


6.	The resources approved for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 totalled $146,935,200, against which expenditures amounted to $135,988,200, resulting in an unencumbered balance of $10,947,000. That represented a budget implementation rate of 92.5 per cent, which was lower than the rate of 97.1 per cent in the previous reporting period.
7.	The unencumbered balance was attributable primarily to underexpenditure in respect of post resources. Unexpended resources were incurred under general temporary assistance, consultants, information technology, medical and other supplies, services and equipment. Overexpenditures in respect of communications and official travel have been recorded.
8.	The unspent balance in respect of post resources was attributable primarily to higher-than-budgeted vacancy rates as follows: 
	(a)	In the Office of Internal Oversight Services, 31 new posts were established, the majority of them for the resident auditor capacity in the peacekeeping missions. The number of new posts placed an extremely heavy workload on the recruitment section of the Executive Office of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The situation was exacerbated by the higher-than-normal turnover of staff in the peacekeeping missions due to the difficult and inadequate living conditions in non-family duty stations and security concerns;
	(b)	In the Procurement Service and the Peacekeeping Financing Division of the Department of Management, there were delays in recruitment resulting from the reprioritization of the workload in support of management review and investigations of procurement cases in the Procurement Service, the heavy workload related to the preparation of budgets and revised budgets for MONUC and MINUSTAH and the preparation of budget estimates related to the United Nations reform.
9.	The savings were also due to the lower-than-budgeted common staff costs and a number of posts being encumbered by staff members at a lower grade level than that budgeted in the Division for Organizational Development of the Office of Human Resources Management.
10.	The underexpenditure under general temporary assistance resulted from a combination of delayed recruitment, the fact that some of the relevant functions were performed through temporary recruitment of staff against vacant posts in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the postponement of planned projects. The field finance training course module was postponed, as General Assembly resolution 60/283, adopting the International Public Sector Accounting Standards for the United Nations, necessitated major changes in the field finance module to align it with those Standards and the implementation of the Enterprise Budget Application project was postponed due to difficulties encountered in the procurement process, resulting in the rebidding of the project to solicit new vendors.
11.	The savings in respect of consultants were attributable primarily to the postponement of various safety training courses in the Department of Safety and Security because of a reprioritization of resources to expand the scope and number of participants in the annual Chief Security Officer/Chief Security Adviser workshop at UNLB, the utilization of in-house staff instead of external consultants in the delivery of a joint European Union/United Nations course on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and a contingent-owned equipment workshop in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
12.	The net overexpenditure recorded under official travel was due primarily to the following:
	(a)	Additional requirements in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations related to an increased level of training activities implemented during the period by the Training and Evaluation Service of the Military Division; 
	(b)	Additional requirements in the Office of Internal Oversight Services related to the comprehensive audit of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
Those additional requirements were offset by savings in the Department of Management, due primarily to the cancellation by the Procurement Service of a planned training course in rapid intervention for start-up missions. The Procurement Service reprioritized its resources to focus on the comprehensive management review of the Service and the internal investigations undertaken on procurement cases. The non-utilization of travel funds by the Peacekeeping Financing Division was due to its heavy workload in connection with the preparation of revised budget estimates for UNOCI and MINUSTAH and the peacekeeping financing proposals contained in the United Nations reform documents. 
13.	The underexpenditure under facilities and infrastructure was due primarily to the use of existing furniture for new staff instead of the purchase of new furniture for all departments and the postponement of required security enhancements for the Investigations Unit at the United Nations Office at Vienna because of the renovation of the premises.
14.	The overexpenditure under communications was due primarily to actual commercial communications rates being higher than the budgeted rate. The budgeted amount of $1,000 per user per year did not take into account requirements for right-to-use charges of approximately $400 per user per year. 
15.	The net savings recorded under information technology were attributable primarily to the postponement of the implementation of the Enterprise Budget Application in the Peacekeeping Financing Division because of procurement difficulties necessitating a rebidding of the procurement process.
16.	The net savings under other services, supplies and equipment was due primarily to (a) a lower-than-planned level of publication of training materials by the Training and Evaluation Service of the Military Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, (b) the non-utilization of the fees for long-distance learning in the Office of Internal Oversight Services because of the reprioritization to focus on the comprehensive management audit of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and (c) the cancellation of planned training activities and the postponement of the production of preventive outreach materials in the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman pending the recommendations of the Redesign Panel.

	4.	Analysis of variances1

VariancePosts$167.10.2%
17.	The net underexpenditure of $167,000 under post resources in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations was due to actual common staff costs being lower than budgeted. Such savings are partly offset by overexpenditures in the Military and Civilian Police Divisions because of the additional recruitment and repatriation costs related to the regular rotation of seconded officers.

VarianceGeneral temporary assistance$899.554.0%
18.	The recorded savings of $899,500 resulted from a combination of delayed recruitment for the positions in question and the fact that some of the functions were performed through temporary recruitment of staff against vacant posts. 
19.	In addition, the underexpenditure was due to the following: 
	(a)	The General Assembly, in its resolution 60/283, approved the adoption by the United Nations of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. As the decision of the General Assembly on the implementation of those Standards will have a direct impact on the Financial Rules and Regulations of the United Nations, the development of the field finance training course module was postponed. 
	(b)	The planned development of new budget templates for the peacekeeping missions was postponed in order to be incorporated into the Enterprise Budget Application project. 

VarianceConsultants$126.428.2%
20.	The underexpenditure of $126,400 was due primarily to the following: 
	(a)	Actual requirements for consultants in relation to the Office of Mission Support’s training activities were lower than budgeted, as training courses and/or workshops were conducted using in-house staff resources instead of external consultants — for example, the joint European Union/United Nations course on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and a contingent-owned equipment workshop; 
	(b)	Net savings of $24,600 under the non-training part of the budget can be ascribed to a number of different reasons: (i) part of the costs related to the development of a rule-of-law network was financed by voluntary contributions; (ii) some projects, including the enhancement of the skills inventory project in the Office of Mission Support and an evaluation of the readiness of the military and civilian police components in MONUC and UNOMIG, were completed within a shorter time than planned; and (iii) postponement of the drafting of a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear policy in the Military Division due to the need for further consultations with Member States and of the development of a rule-of-law index in the Civilian Police Division due to the inability to find a suitable contractor for the funds available following the procurement process. 
21.	These savings were partly offset by the unforeseen requirement of $81,000 for consultants to assist in the preparation of the comprehensive report on the Field Service category requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 58/257.

VarianceOfficial travel($331.6)(13.0%)
22.	The additional requirements of $331,600 were attributable primarily to (a) unforeseen travel activities related to the preparation of a report on reform of the Field Service category; (b) unplanned training activities, including a budget workshop in the Office of Mission Support; and (c) additional expenditures relating to an increased level of training activities led by the Training and Evaluation Service in the Military Division.

VarianceCommunications($154.4)(17.6%)
23.	The overexpenditure of $154,400 was due mainly to actual commercial communications rates being higher than anticipated. The budgeted amount of $1,000 per user per year did not take into account requirements for right-to-use charges of approximately $400 per user per year. For 2007/08 the budgeted provision for commercial communications charges has been revised to $1,400 per user. 

VarianceInformation technology$665.513.9%
24.	The savings of $665,500 were attributable primarily to funds being redeployed to the Department of Management to finance a transfer of functions but not reflected as disbursed in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The funds were redeployed to cover the Information Technology Services Division Tier 2 and 3 support for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, for consultants to conduct a review of United Nations procurement services, for the Information Technology Services Division’s support for the Galaxy e-staffing system and for a joint Information Technology Services Division/Department of Peacekeeping Operations data centre operation.

VarianceOther services, supplies and equipment$291.133.7%
25.	The savings of $291,100 were attributable primarily to the delay in the publication of training materials in the Military Division because of (a) the postponement of certain publications for review and rationalization at the advice of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations; (b) the postponement of the planned revision of certain existing training materials; (c) the delay in the translation of standard training modules 2 and 3 into five languages; and (d) the exhaustion of storage and distribution capacity.

	4.	Analysis of resource variances1

VariancePosts$3 758.226.9%
33.	The underexpenditure of $3,758,200 was due to the actual vacancy rate being higher than the budgeted rate. The main reason for the higher vacancy rate was the delays experienced by the recruitment section of the Executive Office in recruiting for 31 newly established posts. A significant number of the 31 new posts were approved to augment the resident oversight capacity in the peacekeeping missions. Those new posts have generated a high workload for the recruitment section of the Executive Office. The workload was further exacerbated by a higher-than-anticipated staff turnover rate in missions due to the difficult living conditions in non-family duty stations. 

VarianceGeneral temporary assistance$3 314.066.3%
34.	The savings of $3,314,000 were due primarily to the lower rate of implementation than planned. It is recalled that the General Assembly provided capacity, under general temporary assistance, by increasing the number of resident investigators to investigate cases of sexual exploitation and abuse in the peacekeeping missions. The filling of those positions took longer than anticipated due to the difficulty in recruiting candidates willing to live and work in very difficult conditions in non-family duty stations. 

VarianceConsultants$22.45.4%
35.	The net savings of $22,400 were due primarily to the non-utilization of funds approved for forensic experts because such expertise was not required for the cases reviewed during the financial period, and to the utilization of in-house capacity, instead of consultancy, in the training on the use of the electronic working papers software system. The unplanned requirements related to the cost of specific management consulting services in support of the restructuring efforts of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and to higher-than-anticipated costs in relation to a review of military components of peacekeeping and requirements to support the restructuring process in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations during the financial period. 

VarianceOfficial travel($205.3)(14.1%)
36.	The additional requirement of $205,300 was due primarily to the additional travel costs related to the comprehensive management audit of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.

VarianceFacilities and infrastructure$27.257.7%
37.	The unspent balance of $27,200 was attributable primarily to the postponement of required security enhancements, such as the installation of a secure area counter and the installation of a door monitor in Vienna. The postponement was due to a temporary relocation of staff members to other premises while renovations were undertaken to replace asbestos. In addition, the planned acquisition of furniture for new staff members in New York was not undertaken due to the lack of additional office space.

VarianceCommunications$6.013.3%
38.	Savings of $6,000 were recorded under communications due to the postponement of the purchase of eight Blackberries and a satellite phone pending a decision on the organization of functions and distribution of workload and the policy on the usage of Blackberries. 

VarianceInformation technology($12.5)(22.4%)
39.	The overrun of $12,500 was due to the additional cost of scanners for the digital working papers project.

VarianceOther services, supplies and equipment$17.638.3%
40.	The savings of $17,600 were due primarily to the non-utilization of the budgeted fees relating to distance-learning courses for resident auditors on report writing, as the Office of Internal Oversight Services reprioritized their activities in order to complete the comprehensive management audit of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations mandated by the General Assembly in its resolution 59/296.

VarianceConsultants$6.972.3%
44.	The savings were due primarily to the hiring of one consultant, instead of the planned three, in the delivery of the training activities. By relocating the venue of the training course from UNLB to United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Department was able to involve senior-level United Nations staff as resource persons rather than hiring external consultants. In addition, because of the less technical nature of the 2006 exercise, the Department of Public Information was able to identify a number of trainers/facilitators within the United Nations system, whose services were provided free of charge.

VariancePosts$1 266.16.8%
47.	The underexpenditure of $1,266,100 was attributable to a combination of factors: (a) actual vacancy rates being higher than the budgeted rates in the Procurement Division, Peacekeeping Financing Division and the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management; (b) lower-than-budgeted common staff costs in the Division for Organizational Development and the Peacekeeping Financing Division; (c) a number of posts being encumbered by staff members at a lower grade level in the Division for Organizational Development.

VarianceGeneral temporary assistance$163.49.0%
48.	The net savings of $163,400 were attributable primarily to delays in the recruitment for newly established general temporary assistance positions as well as to lower-than-budgeted requirements for replacements for staff on sick and maternity leave. 
49.	Overexpenditures were recorded in the Information Technology Services Division due to requirements for providing Tier 2 and Tier 3 support to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Those expenditures were covered by the redeployment of funds from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to the Department of Management (see para. 24 above). In addition, overexpenditures were recorded in the Peacekeeping Financing Division due to the need for a project manager for the Enterprise Budget Application project to assist in the prolonged negotiations with the external vendor initially selected. 

VarianceConsultants($126.1)(15.9%)
50.	The total additional requirements for consultants in the reporting period amounted to $126,100. The total appropriation of $794,600 for consultants for the reporting period consisted of $283,400 for non-training activities and $511,200 for training activities. The additional requirements emerged in the context of the non-training-related activities, where a total expenditure of $600,700 was recorded. This was due primarily to the non-budgeted requirements for consultancy to undertake a comprehensive management review of the Office of Programme, Planning, Budget and Accounts and a review of Treasury’s operations. 
51.	The additional requirements under the non-training part of the budget were partially offset by savings of $191,200 under training-related consultancies. The lower actual requirements for consultants were attributable to the postponement of planned training activities in the Procurement Service, as the Service had to reprioritize its activities to focus on the internal investigations being carried out on procurement cases.

VarianceOfficial travel$326.941.2%
52.	The savings of $326,900 under travel were due primarily to lower requirements in the Procurement Service, where a training course in rapid intervention for start-up missions was cancelled due to the internal investigations of procurement cases, and in the Division for Organizational Development, where a lower amount than anticipated was required for travel to participate in ethics training. In addition, due to the heavy workload related to the preparation of revised budget estimates for UNOCI and MINUSTAH for the period 2005/06 and the United Nations reform, the planned visits to peacekeeping missions and training in the Funds Monitoring Tool were not undertaken by June 2006.

VarianceCommunications($15.5)(6.9%)
53.	The overexpenditure of $15,500 under communications was due to actual communications charges being slightly higher than budgeted for.

VarianceInformation technology$308.724.0%
54.	The underexpenditure of $308,700 was due primarily to the fact that the development of the Enterprise Budgeting Application was postponed. Funds budgeted for that project were unspent and have been reprogrammed to the current financial period. 
55.	Those savings were partially offset by additional requirements for information technology resources in the Information Technology Services Division for (a) maintenance of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations data centre; (b) network services and (c) provision of support for Galaxy. Those requirements were initially budgeted in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, but were, as mentioned in paragraph 24 above, redeployed to the Information Technology Services Division during the reporting period. In addition, non-budgeted requirements relating primarily to Bloomberg and other software licences were incurred in Treasury.

VarianceOther services, supplies and equipment($218.5)(69.7%)
56.	The overexpenditure of $218,500 was related primarily to the unforeseen requirement for contractual services for the comprehensive management review of the Procurement Service.

	4.	Analysis of resource variances1

VariancePosts$345.821.3%
57.	The unspent balance of $345,800 was attributable to the actual vacancy rate being significantly higher than the budgeted rate. The primary reason for this was the delay in the recruitment process for a P-4 level Security Officer, as the candidate selected had to be released from his mission assignment.

VarianceConsultants$100.0100.0%
58.	The savings of $100,000 were due to the fact that a number of planned safety courses were not undertaken during the reporting period, thus eliminating the need to hire external instructors as foreseen. This was due primarily to a reprioritization of resources to expand the scope and number of participants in the annual Chief Security Officer/Chief Security Adviser workshop at UNLB. The expansion of the workshop was required since the new Department of Safety and Security needed to introduce specific subjects, such as firearms policy and procedure, security information techniques, security policy, investigations responsibilities and approach, crisis management procedures, security training, security personnel management, logistics and finance systems, close protection coordination and serious-incident reporting, to the chiefs of security in the peacekeeping missions. This coordinated approach was to ensure the integration of security management in the United Nations system, as mandated by the General Assembly in its resolution 59/276. In addition, contributing to the underexpenditure was an unexpected delay in the procurement of a contract for a planned sub-machine gun training course, which resulted in the non-delivery of the course during the reporting period.

VarianceOfficial travel ($63.7)(19.5%)
59.	The additional requirements under official travel were attributable primarily to the need for security staff to travel to peacekeeping missions to assist in emergency situations. During the reporting period such travel was required to MONUC in October 2005 to provide hostage-incident management support, to UNMEE in December 2005 to reinforce the Mission’s security section during a crisis, to MINUSTAH in January 2006 to provide critical incident stress management and to Timor-Leste in June 2006 for an assistance mission to enhance security following the period of unrest from April to June and plan for UNMIT. Additional requirements for travel also arose from the planning of the drawdown of ONUB and the establishment of BINUB. An increase in the scope and number of participants in a planned hostage-incident management course also contributed to the overexpenditure. 
60.	Savings, partly offset by the additional requirements above, were achieved because fewer scheduled mission-security compliance visits were carried out due to the reprioritization of resources to the response to emergencies, as well as to the security workshop at UNLB, described above.

VarianceCommunications$4.419.1%
61.	The underexpenditure of $4,400 was attributable primarily to actual costs for commercial communications ($1,500) being significantly lower than budgeted ($2,200). As a consequence, standard rates will be aligned with the rest of the Secretariat in the 2007/08 budget.

VarianceInformation technology$5.337.1%
62.	The variance is due partly to the costs of maintenance for the support account staff inadvertently charged to the regular budget.

63.	All peacekeeping training events requested by Member States were conducted.


	IV.	Adjustment to the assessment for the approved appropriation for the period from 1 July 2006 to
30 June 2007


64.	The General Assembly, in its resolution 60/268, decided that the requirements of $183,187,000 for the support account for peacekeeping for the period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007 would be financed as follows:
	(a)	The unencumbered balance of $3,584,800 and other income of $2,121,900 in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2005, to be applied to the resources required for the financial period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007;
	(b)	The amount of $15,804,000 in excess of the authorized level of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2005, to be applied to the resources required for the financial period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007;
	(c)	The balance of $161,676,300 to be prorated among the budgets of the active peacekeeping operations for the financial period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007; 
65.	The amount in excess of the authorized level of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2005 should have read $2,014,000 instead of $15,804,000, as the General Assembly, in its resolution 59/301, had already authorized the application of the amount of $13,790,000, representing the excess of the authorized level of the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2004. The amount of $2,014,000 is the additional amount contributing to the fund balance in excess of its authorized limit for the financial year ended 30 June 2005.
66.	Due to the application of the amount of $13,790,000 to the resources approved for the financial year 2006/07, the appropriation for the period has been underassessed by that amount. It is therefore proposed that that amount be met from the total savings of $14,377,300 from the financial period ended 30 June 2006, comprising the unencumbered balance of $10,947,000, interest income of $1,931,300, prior-period adjustments of $100,500 and savings on cancellation of obligations of $1,398,500. The remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of $587,300 will be applied to the resources required for the financial period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008, in accordance with established procedures.

	V.	Actions to be taken by the General Assembly


67.	The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are as follows:
	(a)	To decide that Member States shall waive their respective shares in other income for the period ended 30 June 2006 amounting to $3,430,300 and their respective shares in the amount of $10,947,000 from the unencumbered balance for the period ended 30 June 2006, to be retained to meet the additional assessment required of $13,790,000 for the appropriation of the support account for the period from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007;
	(b)	To apply the remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of $587,300 in respect of the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 to the resources required for the period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008.
