		Overview


	28D.1	The Office of Central Support Services is responsible for the implementation of the work programme under this section. The activities for which the Office of Central Support Services is responsible fall under subprogramme 4, Support services, of programme 24, Management and support services, of the biennial programme plan for the period 2008-2009.
	28D.2	The main objectives of the Office include (a) ensuring continued efficient, effective and high-quality support for substantive programmes in the areas of information technology, procurement, travel and transportation, facilities management, archives and records management, and management of commercial activities in meeting the development goals of the Organization, (b) ensuring efficient Secretariat support services to the sessions of the intergovernmental machinery and for the special conferences and meetings held under the auspices of the United Nations, (c) facilitating, through the provision of information and documentation, the deliberations of the General Assembly and its relevant subsidiary organs on specific support service issues under their review, and (d) enabling an integrated and collaborative approach for the Organization to store, search and retrieve information. Within the context of the Secretary-General’s management reforms, efforts to strengthen existing common and joint services among the United Nations organizations will continue. The progress being made in the area of common and joint services is reported in specific reports of the Secretary-General. The Office carries out its activities in cooperation with other departments and offices of the Secretariat. A major challenge anticipated in the biennium 2008-2009 will be the coordination with the Office of the Capital Master Plan and the provision of facility and information and communications technology services necessary to support the first construction phase of the capital master plan while continuing to maintain the premises. Areas of particular concern will be space, asset, archives and records management, given the magnitude of the staff moves required at the onset of the construction. An assessment of the impact of the capital master plan on the operations of the Office of Central Support Services will be provided in the annual report on the capital master plan to the General Assembly.
	28D.3	The total regular budget resource requirements proposed under this section for the biennium 2008-2009 amount to $247,470,500, before recosting, reflecting an increase in the amount of $2,061,700, or 0.8 per cent, as compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2006-2007. The estimated resources under this section of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 may be affected pending consideration by the General Assembly of the report on information and communication technology requested in section II of its resolution 60/283. The report of the Secretary-General will provide detailed information on the structure and staffing requirements of the envisaged information and communication technology structure as well as the lines of responsibility, the functions of the proposed structure and its relationship with other information and communication technology units in the Secretariat, offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions, peacekeeping operations, special political missions and other field offices, including any revision to the existing information and communication technology strategy.
	28D.4	It will be recalled that in his note to the General Assembly (A/61/758), the Secretary-General submitted his comments on the recommendations contained in the report of the Redesign Panel on the United Nations system of administration of justice (A/61/205) and identified the time and resources needed to implement the Panel’s recommendations. The proposed resource redeployments and growth sought in the report as they affect the biennium 2008-2009 have not been incorporated under the present budget section. In its resolution 61/261, the General Assembly decided to establish a new, independent, transparent, professionalized, adequately resourced and decentralized system of administration of justice. In addition, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to report on resources required for the implementation of that resolution as a matter of priority at the second part of its resumed sixty-first session and on issues identified in the resolution regarding the establishment of the new system of administration of justice no later than the early part of the main part of its sixty-second session. Following consideration, decisions of the General Assembly on those reports and the related ongoing resource proposals would be incorporated in the budget appropriation at the time of adoption of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 in December 2007.
	28D.5	By its resolution 61/256, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report, as soon as possible, elaborating on the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the establishment of the Department of Field Support, including functions, budgetary discipline and full financial implications for the consideration of and decision by the General Assembly during its sixty-first session, in accordance with established procedures. Some proposals contained in the requested report would lead to budgetary implications for section 28D, in particular for the Procurement Division. Those implications have not been included in the present budget proposal. Decisions of the General Assembly following consideration of the requested report would be incorporated, as necessary, in the initial appropriation at the time of adoption of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 in December 2007.
	28D.6	The overall net increase of $2,061,700 can be summarized as follows:
		(a)	The net decrease of $5,200 under executive direction and management relates to a reduction in non-post requirements on the basis of pattern of expenditures and internal reallocation of resources;
		(b)	The net increase of $2,066,900 under programme of work relates to an increase of $4,341,100 in other support services due partly to necessary non-post requirements ($2,493,100) in support of the total proposed new posts to be established in Headquarters for the biennium 2008-2009 and other increases ($1,848,000), in particular under utilities, communications, maintenance of office automation equipment and office supplies, partially offset by a decrease in non-post resources of $2,274,200 in information and communication technology services ($2,723,100), partially offset by the proposed establishment of one P-4 and two P-3 level posts ($448,900). 
	28D.7	Regular budget resources under this section are supplemented by extrabudgetary funding derived from programme support income received as reimbursement for the services provided by the central administration for extrabudgetary activities, funds and programmes, as well as from the support account for peacekeeping operations. Extrabudgetary resources are also derived from various sources of funding of Secretariat-wide requirements for the rental and maintenance of premises, telecommunications services and travel services. For the biennium 2008-2009, extrabudgetary resources are estimated at $133,834,500. The increase over current estimates reflects the effect of the expansion of support for peacekeeping operations.
	28D.8	Resources associated with common support services, such as communications, maintenance of office automation equipment, stationery and office supplies, previously centralized under information and communication technology services are proposed to be realigned within the Office of Central Support Services in order to more accurately reflect the managerial responsibilities attached to its various components.
	28D.9	The estimated percentage distribution of the total resources of the Office for the biennium 2008-2009 is shown in table 28D.1.

	28D.18	Resources amounting to $73,745,200 would provide for the posts shown in table 28D.8 (76 Professional, 58 General Service and 1 Trades and Crafts) in the Information Technology Services Division and related non-post requirements. The increase in post requirements relates to the proposed establishment of one P-4 level post, the incumbent of which would be responsible for the security systems projects, including Access control, Closed Circuits and Intrusion Detection Systems as well as for the provision of expert advice on Security Systems Integration, and two P-3 level posts, the incumbents of which would be responsible for the planning, support, design, installation and testing of physical security systems and maintenance and management of changes in the information technology components, as well as providing strategic advice on security issues as a whole. The resources under non-post requirements, reflecting a decrease of $2,723,100, would cover the work programme detailed in paragraph 28D.14 above. The decrease, resulting from the proposed reduction of resources under general operating expenses, supplies and materials, and furniture and equipment, mainly reflects the proposed realignment of resources indicated in paragraph 28D.8 above and the discontinuation of resources under grants and contributions since the mainframe services provided by the International Computer Centre are replaced by internally hosted solutions. The decreases are partly offset by increases under (a) general temporary assistance and overtime that would ensure the maintenance of the Web Focus software and enterprise reporting, and the configuration and installation of Portfolio Management tools and would assess opportunities for further automation of services provided to Member States; and (b) contractual services for the implementation of initiatives under the information and communications technology strategy for the proactive development of enterprise-wide application solutions ranging from specialized scopes (e-PAS, iSeek) to global system-wide applications, including security features for Headquarters and offices away from Headquarters as well as acquisition and implementation of applications and databases; software licences and protection of software against hacker intrusion.

	28D.22	Resources amounting to $171,456,800 would provide for the continuation of 315 posts in the Facilities and Commercial Services Division and related non-post requirements. The increase under non-post requirements ($4,341,100) is due to the standard provision for office facilities for the total proposed new posts to be established in Headquarters included under various sections of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 as well as an internal reallocation of resources, particularly under general operating expenses, including communications and maintenance of office automation equipment, and under supplies and materials, including stationery.

	Table 28D.11	Summary of follow-up action taken to implement the relevant recommendations of the oversight bodies


Brief description
of the recommendationAction taken to implement
the recommendationAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
(A/60/7 and Corr.1)The Committee pointed out that more should be done to (para. VIII.41):
(a)	Expand functions that could be more efficiently performed by contractors;

Review of this issue is carried out on an ongoing basis.(b)	Improve space management through close coordination of space requirements with funds and programmes;The Facilities and Commercial Services Division is regularly in contact with funds and programmes to align space requirements or identify availability of office space when organizational needs arise.(c)	Improve global contracts with airlines so that other duty stations could make more use of discounted rates;The Organization entered into an additional global agreement with an international carrier offering reduced airfares to offices in all countries that the carrier serves. Further, the United Nations offices at New York and Geneva have been successful in including in several airline agreements the possibility of applying negotiated discounts on airfares bidirectionally, that is, the trip can originate in offices away from the respective headquarters. Local agreements of such nature often provide deeper discounts than global agreements. The Facilities and Commercial Services Division is continuing its effort to expand these travel arrangements.(d)	Facilitate and expand the access of permanent missions at Headquarters and other main duty stations to information systems in use by the Organization, including the Internet, Intranet and ODS (para. VIII.41).Desktop computers and Wi-Fi in strategic areas in the Secretariat building have been installed to allow access to the Internet, ODS, and other information sources. Further, systems have been developed to assist delegates in their work (such as Candiweb, a secure website to facilitate elections to various committees).
Planned enterprise solutions, such as enterprise content management, and a portal would increase access to Secretariat information resources. However, the delivery of latter projects is contingent upon funding being made available for the enterprise platforms in question. The Secretariat’s work on identity management is also geared to facilitating this.The Committee noted with concern that a substantial degree of decentralization remains in information and communications technology.This is part of the long-term strategy of the Secretariat that was outlined by the Secretary-General in his interim report on information and communications technology (A/61/765). It is expected to effectively address this issue as funding and support is made available.The Committee was concerned that not much progress has been achieved in terms of improved governance of information and communications technology systems since its review of the proposed budget for 2004-2005; there continue to be a number of systems and databases, such as IMIS, the Budget Information System, IMDIS, Galaxy and Mercury, that are not compatible with each other or that require complicated systems of bridges to keep them interconnected (para. VIII.42).This issue is also of concern to the Secretariat. However efforts to implement the subject recommendation through the planned introduction of enterprise applications such as the enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and enterprise content management will not be successful unless approved for implementation and appropriately funded and supported.Report of the Board of Auditors
(A/59/5, vol. I, chap. II)The Board recommended that the United Nations adopt and implement a uniform methodology for determining the total cost of information and communications technology with a view to improving the decision-making process on such issues as outsourcing and cost recovery (para. 89).The Information Technology Services Division continues to implement initiatives to realize the goals of this recommendation as reflected by the following outcomes:
On 8 August 2005, an Administrative Instruction on information and communications technology initiatives was issued (ST/AI/2005/10), which created the requirement of a high-level business case for information and communications technology initiatives in support of the relevant portions of proposed budget requests. In this connection, a needs-based training campaign has been undertaken by the Information Technology Services Division on how to develop high-level business cases in accordance with established professional best practices and standards in project management and costing methodologies. Review and revision of standard costs for cost recovery by applying a uniform methodology are being prepared for inclusion in the budget instructions for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.
The Information Technology Services Division expects to continue implementation of this recommendation during 2007 following the approval of a Chief Information Technology Officer to oversee the creation and implementation of an effective information management strategy.The Board recommended that the United Nations review the delegations of authority, methodology and monitoring for the management of computerized data and information (para. 95).It is expected that with the approval of the post of Chief Information Technology Officer under the Secretary-General’s management reform agenda, these issues will be revisited and will be addressed in the context of the new information and communications technology governance strategy.The Board recommended that the Administration establish, as planned, a formal portfolio of information and communications technology assets in line with the best information and communications technology industry practices in order to provide a complete view of information and communications technology initiatives, projects and facilities across all United Nations organizational units (para. 97).The Information and Communications Technology Board and its task forces govern information and communications technology in the Secretariat and have responsibility to review and approve initiatives and standards. Those governance entities have been addressing the risk identified by the Board of Auditors regarding the need for a “total view of current information and communications technology assets” by ensuring the achievement of the following objectives:
	•	Standardization of information and communications technology initiatives
	•	Analysis and approval of information and communications technology high-level business cases
	•	Consistent application of information and communications technology procurement standards
The above listed functions are supported by eAssets (electronic assets management database).Planned actions for the next biennium
During the biennium 2008-2009, the Information Technology Services Division expects to:
	•	Automate high-level business case processing
	•	Automate standards case processing
	•	Standardize project status and reporting processes
	•	Capture and maintain key information for all major technology initiatives and assets 
	•	Enable pro-active resource forecasting based on future project demand
	•	Enable strategic alignment of the portfolio against overall goals and priorities of the United Nations
	•	Reduce redundancy by enabling access to a comprehensive project and asset inventory
	•	Provide financial and operational transparency for all projects 
	•	Identify opportunities for consolidationThe Board recommended that the Administration ascertain that training programmes on the development and implementation of an information and communication strategy are available and coordinated (para. 99).This recommendation has been implemented through training of staff in the development of information and communications technology strategies and workshops on high-level business case methodology for an information and communications technology initiative.The Board recommended that the Administration continue to take appropriate steps to adopt common standards and best practices, including documenting “lessons learned” exercises (para. 102).See action taken to implement the recommendation of the Board of Auditors (A/61/5, vol. I, para. 232).Report of the Board of Auditors
(A/61/5, vol. I, chap. II)The Board recommended that the Administration establish a written information and communications technology quality plan, based on the Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT) audit guidelines for planning and organization, and consider customizing the operations in accordance with the standard COBIT quality assurance approach or framework adopted (para. 232).This recommendation will be implemented by the end of the biennium within the context of the implementation of the ISO 9001 standard, a quality management system that will complement the ISO 27001-based information security management system (see A/61/214, para. 50).Office of Internal Oversight Services
(A/60/682)The Department of Management should ensure that the Office of Central Support Services identifies the most efficient space criterion for estimating rental costs, using a single measurement for rental cost, which could be either the number of square feet per grade or a flat average number of square feet per staff member regardless of grade (para. 57).This recommendation has been implemented.
A flat rate per staff member has been established for estimating rental costs.The Department of Management should ensure that the Information Technology Services Division reviews the cost structure of the service-level agreements in order to reflect actual costs. The revised service-level agreements should be included in the standard cost guidelines (para. 69).The review of the cost structure of the service-level agreements has been completed, and revised rates were incorporated as part of the instructions for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.The Department of Management should develop a policy clarifying the determination of an efficient printer/desktop ratio (para. 71).The ratio defined in General Assembly resolution 59/296 was adopted in the preparation of the 2006/07 support account budget. 
In addition, the Information Technology Services Division is in the final stage of implementation of a photocopier/printing network project, which will enable the Secretariat to further rationalize the use of printers in the future.The Department of Management should update the costs of acquiring desktop computers, printers and laptop computers set out in the standard cost guidelines whenever new contractual agreements or market conditions require such a change, thereby ensuring that costs reflect prices and conditions offered by selected providers (para. 73).A recent review of the costs for desktop computers, printers and laptops has been completed and new rates were incorporated in the Instructions for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.Office of Internal Oversight Services
(A/60/717)The Department of Management should defer the two high-level business cases that have an impact on the systems and processes of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations pending the formulation of an integrated solution that would meet both departments’ needs, also considering the strategic direction the Secretariat will take regarding the future of IMIS (para. 102).The Department of Management acknowledged and agreed with the need to integrate high-level business case proposals with the strategic direction of the overall information and communications technology environment of the Secretariat but did not concur with the recommendation because the Information Technology Services Division of the Department of Management believes that the budget formulation system proposed by the Peacekeeping Finance Division of the Department of Management is aligned with the overall information and communications technology strategy of the Secretariat and can be integrated with any enterprise resource planning solution that the Organization may adopt in the future.
