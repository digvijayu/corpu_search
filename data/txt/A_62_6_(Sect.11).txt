		Overview


	11.1	The programme was established following the final review and appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s in 2002. As a result of that review, in its resolution 57/7, the General Assembly brought to a close the New Agenda and endorsed the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as the framework for the provision of international support for African development (NEPAD was formally adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its thirty-seventh ordinary session, held in Lusaka in July 2001). The General Assembly also outlined the substantive areas to receive support and the modalities for providing such support, underscoring the need for a structure in the Secretariat in New York to review and report on the support provided by the United Nations system and the international community for NEPAD and on the coordinated implementation of outcomes of summit meetings and conferences as they relate to Africa as well as to coordinate global advocacy in support of the New Partnership. In addition, the Assembly welcomed the actions being taken at the regional level by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) to organize the activities of the United Nations system around thematic clusters covering the priority areas of NEPAD and, in that regard, urged the strengthening of the process as a means of enhancing the effective response of the United Nations system in support of the New Partnership. It called upon the United Nations system to enhance its advocacy role and public information activities in support of Africa’s development. Subsequently, in its resolution 57/300, the Assembly endorsed the creation of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa and entrusted to the Special Adviser the role of coordinating reports and advocacy in support of NEPAD. The role of the Office in supporting NEPAD has been reaffirmed by the Assembly in a series of subsequent resolutions.
	11.2	At the 2005 World Summit, world leaders reaffirmed their commitment to address the special needs of Africa, the only continent not on track to meet any of the goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) by 2015. The New Partnership includes a commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, which represents an important linkage with the Millennium Declaration. NEPAD substantially reflects the priorities on meeting the special needs of Africa as set out in the Millennium Declaration, namely, supporting the political and institutional structures of emerging democracies in Africa; further building peacekeeping capacity, in cooperation with regional organizations; taking special measures to address the challenges of poverty reduction and sustainable development by cancelling debt, increasing official development assistance, enhancing private capital flows and building capacity for trade; and helping Africa to build its capacity to tackle the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Consequently, through its support for NEPAD, the programme will contribute substantively to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals in Africa.
	11.3	A major barrier to the development of Africa has been the persistence of conflict in some of the countries of the region. The need to develop a comprehensive means of promoting peace and security and development has long been recognized and was articulated in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa (A/52/871-S/1998/318). Since 1998, a number of United Nations initiatives in Africa have been in line with the recommendations of the report, although a great deal still needs to be done. Thus, by its resolution 60/223, the Assembly called upon the Secretary-General to continue to monitor progress in the implementation of the recommendations.
	11.4	In accordance with the mandate provided in the General Assembly resolutions, the programme aims to: (a) mobilize the support and galvanize the efforts of the international community for African peace and development; (b) ensure that the development of Africa remains one of the main priorities of the international community; (c) promote a supportive international framework for African development efforts; (d) encourage a coordinated and effective response by the United Nations system at the policy and operational levels in support of African development; and (e) strengthen and enhance South-South cooperation in support of the advancement of Africa.
	11.5	Regional and international efforts have focused on the implementation of the New Partnership and on assisting Africa in developing a robust architecture for peace and security. The programme will support those efforts through a mix of analytical work, advocacy and outreach and improvement in the coordination of the work of the United Nations system in support of African development.
	11.6	The Office of the Special Adviser for Africa provides overall coordination and leadership of the programme, which will be under the joint responsibility of the Office of the Special Adviser for Africa, ECA and the Department of Public Information.
	11.7	The issue of publications as a part of the programme of work has been reviewed in the context of each subprogramme. It is anticipated that recurrent and non-recurrent publications will be issued as summarized in table 11.1 and as described in the output information for each subprogramme.

	11.8	The overall resources required for the biennium 2008-2009 under this section amount to $11,186,300 before recosting, reflecting an increase of $383,200 (or 3.5 per cent). The growth shown in tables 11.3 and 11.4 can be summarized as follows:
		(a)	A net increase of $289,800 under subprogramme 1 as a result of: (i) an increase of $278,600 as a consequence of the delayed impact of two new Professional posts (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) approved for the biennium 2006-2007; and (ii) an increase in the amount of $15,900 reflecting the cost of the service-level agreement with the Information Technology Services Division, Office of Central Support Services, partially offset by reductions totalling $4,700 for non-recurrent non-post items;
		(b)	A net increase of $95,000 under subprogramme 2 as a result of an increase of $181,000 for one proposed additional Programme Officer post (P-4), partially offset by a decrease of $86,000 under non-post resources;
		(c)	A decrease of $1,600 under subprogramme 3 as a result of reduced public information and external printing costs.
	11.9	During the biennium 2008-2009, the projected extrabudgetary resources, amounting to $470,000, will complement resources from the regular budget to finance various activities, such as: (a) the preparation of policy papers on emerging issues in Africa, with an emphasis on the nexus between peace and development; (b) follow-up activities relating to the fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development; (c) activities enhancing human security in Africa; and (d) advocacy and promotional materials relating to NEPAD.
	11.10	Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269, resources identified for the conduct of monitoring and evaluation would amount to $84,200, funded from regular budget resources and reflected under each subprogramme. 
	11.11	The estimated percentage distribution of the programme resources in the biennium 2008-2009 is shown in table 11.2.
	11.12	The distribution of resources is summarized in tables 11.3 and 11.4.

	11.16	The amount of $7,360,100, reflecting an increase of $289,800, is required for the continuation of 21 posts and related non-post resources. The increase of $278,600 under posts is a result of the delayed impact of two new Professional posts (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) approved for the biennium 2006-2007. The net increase in non-post requirements is largely attributable to the increased cost of the service-level agreement with the Information Technology Services Division.

	11.24	The amount of $2,252,500, reflecting a decrease of $1,600, provides for the continuation of seven posts and related non-post requirements. The decrease is attributable to reduced production costs associated with public information materials produced under contractual services, partially offset by the increased cost of the service-level agreement with the Information Technology Services Division and travel requirements in connection with attending events and meetings, on-the-ground research and the coverage of regional developments.
