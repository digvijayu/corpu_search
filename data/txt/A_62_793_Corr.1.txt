		Paragraph 42

The paragraph should read
		Client services

42.	While providing core technological capabilities to the Organization remains the foundation of all ICT activities, the effective delivery of services requires close alignment with all departments, offices and missions. To achieve this, the Office of Information and Communications Technology includes three units — Headquarters services (New York-based), field services and global services — which are dedicated to maintaining this close association between the Office and other organizational units. Each unit is led by a senior client services manager who reports directly to the Chief Information Technology Officer. These client services units are accountable and responsible to their respective organizational units for the full range of ICT programmes and services available. The professionals who serve in this capacity must build strong relationships with their clients to ensure the strategic alignment of ICT to substantive work programmes and to ensure continuous customer satisfaction for all of the departments within their purview.
