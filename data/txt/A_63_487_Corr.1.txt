Paragraph 29 should be in boldface type:
29.	The Advisory Committee considers that the transfer of the P-5 post would weaken the management structure of the Information and Communications Technology Division, which has only two P-5 posts. Given the existing capacity of the Information Technology Services Division, which already has 13 P-5 posts, the Committee is of the view that the consideration of the transfer of the post should be deferred until the review referred to in paragraph 14 above has been completed.
