		Report of the independent expert on human rights and international solidarity
		Note by the Secretariat
1.	In its resolution 15/13, the Human Rights Council requested the independent expert on human rights and international solidarity to submit a report on the implementation of resolution 15/13 to the Council at its eighteenth session. By its decision 16/118, the Council decided to postpone the renewal of the mandate of the independent expert to its seventeenth session, and for that reason to extend the mandate of the independent expert until June 2011.
2.	The above-mentioned report will therefore be submitted by the independent expert following the renewal of the mandate and the appointment of a new mandate holder by the Human Rights Council.
