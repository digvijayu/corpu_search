INFORMATION NOTICE1

Note by the Secretariat


I.	INTRODUCTION

1.	The UNECE Committee on Economic Cooperation and Integration (CECI) promotes a policy, financial and regulatory environment conducive to economic growth, innovative development and higher competitiveness in the UNECE region. 

2.	At its third session held on 3-5 December 2008, the UNECE Committee on Economic Cooperation and Integration (CECI), recognizing the importance of information and communication technologies (ICT) for strengthening innovation-based competitiveness “welcomed a stronger emphasis on capacity-building activities and policy advisory services in the Programme of Work for 2009-2010”2. In accordance with that recommendation, 
the Committee decided to organize an International Conference on Technological Readiness for Innovation-based Competitiveness: Promoting and Enabling Information and Communication Technology Policy and Regulatory Framework.

3.	ICT is an integral part of the knowledge-based economy. Similar to earlier industrial revolutions, the wide diffusion of ICT has contributed significantly to raising economic efficiency and has triggered a revolutionary transformation of everyday life. In the business sector, ICT have given rise to new innovative products and services and new ways of doing business. 

4.	The wide usage of ICT and the proliferation of ICT networks have facilitated new forms of collaboration in innovative activities and innovation processes.  The innovation process itself has become increasingly open, with enterprises often obtaining ideas and knowledge for innovation from external or even global sources. ICT facilitates linkages and cooperation among firms. Thanks to ICT-based business-process outsourcing, innovative enterprises in emerging economies also play an important role as global suppliers of services. 

5.	At the same time, many ICT-related innovative enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are facing specific challenges in securing adequate financing to support their operations and develop new services and products.  These problems are even more acute now due to the negative effects of the global economic and financial crisis.  Open innovation and ICT-based collaborative models have given rise to new challenges in the domain of intellectual property rights (IPR). These and other related aspects will be among the issues addressed at the International Conference.

6.	This Information Notice provides some details regarding the organization of the Conference, which will be held in Geneva on 29 and 30 June 2009.  

II.	OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE

7.	The Conference will address selected policy-relevant issues related to the promotion of ICT-based technological readiness, innovation and competitiveness.  It will seek to cover related cross-cutting issues, highlighting the importance of ICT in different CECI thematic areas, such as innovation and competitiveness policies; commercialization and protection of intellectual property rights; financing innovative development; entrepreneurship and enterprise development. 

8.	In view of the cross-cutting nature of many of the topics to be discussed, members of the UNECE Teams of Specialists on Innovation and Competitiveness Polices and on Intellectual Property will take part in the Conference. 

9.	The Conference will aim to clarify issues related to the promotion of ICT-based technological readiness, innovation and competitiveness and to facilitate the sharing of good practices among policymakers, experts and other stakeholders.  It will identify good practices in promoting an enabling policy and on regulatory frameworks to strengthen the basis of member countries’ knowledge-based development. 

10. 	It will address the following key policy-relevant issues: 
(a) Promoting enabling ICT policies and strategies for an efficient knowledge-based economy;
(b) Facilitating the wide diffusion of ICT and ICT-based applications as a prerequisite for innovative entrepreneurship;
(c) Policies and strategies to support the emergence and financing of innovative enterprises in the ICT and ICT-enabled sectors and coping with the negative effects of the global crisis;
(d) Promoting new ICT-based business opportunities in countries with economies in transition to enable them to participate in global value chains;
(e) Policies supporting ICT-based entrepreneurship as the future basis of innovation-based competitiveness;
(f) Policies and regulatory framework in facilitating e-business development and ensuring security in cyberspace;
(g) Promotion of a supportive ICT infrastructure as a factor contributing to open innovation and collaboration;
(h) Policy responses to IPR challenges related to open and global ICT-based innovation activities; and
(i) Policy coordination and the role of public institutions in support of innovative ICT-based SMEs.

11.	A report containing the main conclusions of the Conference will be presented at the fourth session of the UNECE Committee on Economic Cooperation and Integration.  The results of the Conference will also be used as inputs in preparing a training module on ICT policy for promoting innovation-based competitiveness, including e-commerce regulatory framework, to be used in future capacity-building work.  The module is to be delivered in 2010.
