The Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Informatics recommends that an information and communication technologies task force be created with the objectives of providing overall leadership to the United Nations role in helping to formulate strategies for the development of information and communication technologies and putting those technologies at the service of development and, on the basis of consultations with all stakeholders and Member States, forging a strategic partnership between the United Nations system, private industry and financing trusts and foundations, donors, programme countries and other relevant stakeholders.
2.	The Working Group recommends that the Secretary-General undertake consultations with all stakeholders and Member States regarding the composition, governance structure, mandate, terms of reference, secretarial support and project implementation arrangements of the task force and the trust fund, taking into account, inter alia, the following elements:

		Mandate

	•	Identify and mobilize new resources, public and private;
	•	Promote effective utilization of existing resources for ICT for development;
	•	Promote collaborative initiatives, at the request of and in consultation with programme countries, for ICT programmes and projects, including at the regional, subregional and national levels, taking into account the provisions of paragraphs 14 to 17 of the Ministerial Declaration of the high-level segment of the substantive session of 2000 of the Economic and Social Council;
