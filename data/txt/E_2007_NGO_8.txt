		Statement submitted by Foundation for Research on Technology Migration and Integration, a non-governmental organization in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council

Statement


In support of the 2007 theme of the HLS for ECOSOC, “Strengthening efforts at all levels to promote pro-poor sustained economic growth, including through equitable macroeconomic policies”, the Foundation for Research on Technology Migration and Integration would like to emphasize once again the importance and the role of governance- especially good governance and the strength of human capital in supporting pro-poor sustained economic growth.

Since the adoption of the recommendation of “ One Dollar for Development” at a meeting of non-G8 member states at FAO in Rome in 2004, the foundation has led many advocacy efforts, including a presentation on 22 June 2006 of Formit Foundation, through its subsidiary Formit Servizi, before an Informal Interactive Hearing of the General Assembly.  The Hearings, a review of the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action, were intended to serve as a forum for NGOs, civil society, and the private sector to express their respective views on sustainable development and on best practices in the efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

The Formit Foundation drew attention to the substantial prospective value ICTs can have in improving  governance  and reducing  poverty  in  the  LDCs. Specifically, the Foundation highlighted the initiative One Dollar for Development, which seeks   donations from  developed  countries  of  e-government technologies  already in use, and whose implementation would obviate the need  for LDCs to invest the significant funds that would be required to develop and deploy their own e-government applications.

The Formit Foundation exhorted  the  LDCs  to  create  an  enabling  environment for such  applications,  and  the  United Nations  to  play  an  active  role  in facilitating the technology transfer.

Below  are  two  paragraphs  from  the  Outcome Document A/61/162 of the Informal Interactive  General  Assembly Hearings,  which summarize The Formit Foundation’s recommendations and speak to their importance.

Paragraph   34:     The  importance  of  information  and  communication technology  (ICT)  to  the  achievement  of the goals and targets of the Brussels  Programme  was  underlined  by  various  participants.  It was stressed that ICT can be used to promote democratic governance and poverty reduction.

Paragraph 35:  To benefit fully from ICT, the least developed countries need software applications, particularly in the area of e-governance. Donors, both public and private, were called upon to assist the least developed countries in making this software available, as financial resources remain inadequate. Recommendations were made for:

(a)  donor  countries to offer free e-governance software investments in the  least  developed  countries  and  encourage software-reuse at the national  level,  as well as open source technologies and multi-language software interfaces in their ICT development;

(b)  the  least developed countries to create an enabling environment to facilitate   transfer   of   knowledge   and  ensure compatibility  and sustainability with regard to infrastructure, local industries and human capital; and

(c)  the United Nations to play a central role in the creation of an ICT framework.
