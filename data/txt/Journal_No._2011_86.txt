Reporting to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms
		A note verbale concerning “Transparency in armaments” (ODA/09-2011/TIA) was issued on 3 March 2011. With reference to General Assembly resolution 64/54 (A/RES/64/54),
it calls upon Member States to provide by Tuesday, 31 May 2011, national reports to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms on international transfers of conventional arms and also invites, on an optional basis, to submit information on procurement through national production, military holdings and on international transfers of small arms and light weapons (SALW).  
		In accordance with the aforementioned resolution, Member States are also requested to present with their national reports the views on whether the inclusion of SALW as a main category in the Register would increase its relevance and influence on decisions to participate. 
		For further information and assistance, please contact Mr. Yuriy Kryvonos, Political Affairs Officer, Conventional Arms Branch, Office for Disarmament Affairs (e-mail kryvonos@un.org; tel. 1 (917) 367-1096).

Security Council		Communications to the President of the Security Council
		Communications addressed to the President of the Security Council should be delivered to the Offices of the Security Council Secretariat Branch (room 08083, 730 Third Avenue (between 45th and 46th Streets); tel. 1 (212) 963-5258).
		Web site of the presidency
		The Web site of the presidency of the Security Council can be visited at <www.un.org/sc/presidency.asp>.
		Recorded information
		Recorded information about previously unscheduled meetings and consultations of the whole of the Security Council may be obtained by calling 1 (212) 963-8530, or by clicking on “Daily Programme” on the Web site of the Security Council <www.un.org/Docs/sc>.
		Prepared statements
		Speakers in the Security Council are advised that providing in advance copies of prepared statements which they intend to read out in the Council greatly facilitates the work of the Secretariat by permitting a sufficient number of copies to be distributed to all meeting participants and by assisting interpreters, verbatim reporters and press officers in maintaining the quality of the product delivered. Both interpretations and verbatim records rely upon the statement actually delivered, but copies of texts help interpreters to correctly render details and nuances and help verbatim reporters to produce the written record more quickly. Speakers are therefore encouraged, whenever possible, to provide copies of their statements, as early as possible in advance of delivery, to the Conference Officer in the Chamber.
		Delegations are kindly requested to make 40 copies for minimum distribution to Council members and relevant services, and 200 additional copies for general distribution in the Security Council Chamber. 
		Delegations wishing to make statements available for the media are kindly requested to deliver 50 copies to the Media Documents Centre (e-mail mdc@un.org; tel. 1 (212)
