United Nations Regional Course in International Law for Asia-Pacific: Urgent appeal 
for voluntary contributions 
		The Regional Courses in International Law provide high quality training by leading scholars and practitioners on a broad range of core subjects of international law, as well as specific subjects of particular interest to developing countries in a given region. The Regional Courses provide an important mechanism for expanding the international law training opportunities available to lawyers from developing countries under the Programme of Assistance given the limited number of participants which can be accommodated in the International Law Fellowship Programme. The Regional Courses also provide an opportunity for the participants to focus on contemporary issues of international law of common concern in the region with a view to promoting greater understanding and cooperation on such issues.
		As the Regional Courses are dependent on voluntary contributions, the Codification Division of the Office of Legal Affairs is urgently seeking contributions from Member States in order to ensure sufficient funding for the Regional Course for Asia-Pacific, which is scheduled to take place from Monday, 4, to Friday, 29 November 2013,
in Thailand. For additional information or inquiries, please contact Ms. Virginia
Morris, Principal Legal Officer, Codification Division, Office of Legal Affairs (e-mail rcil-asia@un.org; tel. 1 (917) 367-5284).

Security Council		Communications to the President of the Security Council
		Communications addressed to the President of the Security Council should be delivered to the Office of the President of the Council (room S-2472; tel. 1 (212) 963-5258;
fax 1 (917) 367-0406).
		Web of the presidency
		The website of the presidency of the Security Council can be visited at www.un.org/en/sc/presidency/.
		Recorded information
		Recorded information about previously unscheduled meetings and consultations of the whole of the Security Council may be obtained by calling 1 (212) 963-8530, or by clicking on “Programme of work” on the website of the Security Council www.un.org/en/sc/.
		Prepared statements
		Speakers in the Security Council are advised that providing in advance copies of prepared statements which they intend to read out in the Council greatly facilitates the work of the Secretariat by permitting a sufficient number of copies to be distributed to all meeting participants and by assisting interpreters, verbatim reporters and press officers in maintaining the quality of the product delivered. Both interpretations and verbatim records rely upon the statement actually delivered, but copies of texts help interpreters to correctly render details and nuances and help verbatim reporters to produce the written record more quickly. Speakers are therefore encouraged, whenever possible, to provide copies of their statements, as early as possible in advance of delivery, to the Conference Room Officer in the Chamber.
		Delegations are kindly requested to make 40 copies for minimum distribution to Council members and relevant services, and 200 additional copies for general distribution in the Security Council Chamber. 
		Delegations wishing to make statements available for the media are kindly requested to deliver 50 copies to the Media Documents Centre (e-mail mdc@un.org; tel. 1 (212)
963-7166; room SA-1B12).

Announcement for Member States on issuance of communications
		Delegations requesting issuance of communications as documents of the General Assembly should ensure that they are addressed to the Secretary-General and signed
by the Permanent Representative or Chargé d’affaires of the Permanent Mission to the United Nations.
