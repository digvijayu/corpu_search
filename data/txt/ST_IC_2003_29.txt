2.	The Organization may block or restrict access to any Internet resource at any time and without notice when it is deemed to be in the best interest of the Organization.

As Internet resources are essential for the delivery of mission-critical services to the Organization, such as e-mail, the World Wide Web, Extranets and Intranets, and web applications, it is imperative to immediately protect these resources from threat and risk as the need arises.
