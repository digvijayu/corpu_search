Information circular*

	To:	Members of the staff

	From:	The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management

	Subject:	Human Resources Handbook


1.	The Human Resources Handbook provides managers, administrators and staff with streamlined access to up-to-date information on personnel-related regulations, rules and policies. The Office of Human Resources Management is pleased to announce that the French version of the Handbook, Manuel de gestion des ressources humaines, is now available on iSeek and on the Internet.


	*	The present circular will be in effect until further notice.
2.	The electronic version of the Handbook was created for easy updating and maintenance. A hard copy does not exist. However, the official documents contained in the Handbook, such as administrative issuances and information circulars, will for the time being continue to be distributed in print as they are issued. They are also available on the Optical Disk System.

		Access

3.	The Information Technology Services Division continues to provide access to the Handbook for users with a connection to iSeek. Users can select either the English or the French version from the first page of the HR Handbook site.
4.	The Handbook is available on iSeek through:
	(a)	The Office of Human Resources Management page (accessible using the “Human Resources” link under “Quicklinks”);
	(b)	The drop-down menu under Topics by selecting “Human Resources” and then “HR Handbook”;
	(c)	The Department of Management page by selecting “HR Handbook” from the list on the left side of the screen.
5.	For staff who do not have access to iSeek, the English and French versions of the Handbook have been posted in password-protected areas, which the user may access by entering the following address and, when requested, the user name and password:
	English version:						French version:
	www.un.org/hr_handbook				www.un.org/french/grh_manuel
	User name: handbook					User name: manuel
	Password: handbook					Password: manuel
However, several features of the Handbook, such as hyperlinks to forms and other documents posted on internal sites, as well as additional search features, are available only if the user is connected to iSeek.

		Updates

6.	The Handbook is updated on a regular basis. While navigation of the Handbook is self-explanatory, the user, by clicking the “Read me first” or “À lire avant d’aller plus loin” buttons in the English and French versions, respectively, will obtain a list of newly posted data under “What’s new?” or “Nouveautés”. The same button will also lead to useful navigation tips, including the choice of browsers.

		Focal points

7.	In order to maintain continued access at all duty stations and missions and to facilitate the introduction of the Handbook to new staff members, Matthew Sanidas and Nelinda Romero in the Office of Human Resources Management have been designated to serve as focal points for any questions that users may have. The focal points will work with the Information Technology Services Division and other technical experts at the various duty stations to ensure optimal use of both versions of the Handbook.
