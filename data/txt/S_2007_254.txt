In December 2006, the Security Council undertook the comprehensive review of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate in accordance with its decision of 21 December 2005 (see S/PRST/2005/64). The Council endorsed the Counter-Terrorism Committee’s review report (S/2006/989) which, together with the statement by the President of the Security Council of 20 December 2006 (S/PRST/2006/56), provided guidance for the future work of the Committee and the Executive Directorate, in particular the following:
	•	The guiding principles of the work of the Committee are cooperation, transparency and even-handedness, as well as consistency in approach. 
	•	The Committee shall continue to strengthen its relations with international, regional and subregional organizations in promoting and assisting States in the implementation of resolution 1373 (2001).
	•	The Committee shall work on identifying and promoting best practices in all key areas of resolution 1373 (2001).
	•	The Committee shall ensure that any measures taken by States to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular human rights law, refugee law and humanitarian law.

	•	The Committee shall play its part in the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (General Assembly resolution 60/288).
	•	In the fulfilment of its mandate, the Committee is assisted by the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, under the policy guidance of the Plenary. In this regard, the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate will implement the policy guidance of the Committee through its sixth work programme (see appendix).


		Work programme


3.	The Committee will focus its work on the three priority objectives below:

		Monitoring and promoting the implementation of resolution 1373 (2001)

4.	The Committee, on the basis of initial assessments by its subcommittees, will consider the preliminary implementation assessments and approve, where appropriate, recommendations prepared by the Executive Directorate and send them to all Member States concerned for appropriate action, in accordance with the procedures for the Counter-Terrorism Committee’s updated working methods. 
5.	On the basis of the global analysis prepared by the Executive Directorate, the Committee will consider the status of implementation by all States of resolution 1373 (2001), including detected gaps of particular concern, and elaborate possible additional measures to enhance implementation. Subsequently, the Committee will brief Security Council members on the results of their consideration of this item. 
6.	The Committee will also continue to reflect on additional ways to address the case of States that do not meet the requirements of resolution 1373 (2001).
7.	In close cooperation with the 1267 (1999) and 1540 (2004) Committees, and consistent with its mandate, the Committee will pay special attention to those States which are late in submitting relevant information to it and discuss how best to address the issue in order to strengthen the implementation of resolution 1373 (2001) and other relevant resolutions. 
8.	The Committee will discuss ways and means of encouraging States to become party to and implement the provisions of the relevant international conventions and protocols related to terrorism and amendments thereto on the basis of the analysis prepared by the Executive Directorate.
9.	The Committee will continue discussions and take steps to ensure that visits to States upon their consent lead to enhancing the States’ implementation of resolution 1373 (2001) and assess the results of such visits and consider proper follow-up. Furthermore, the Committee will consider discussion on updating the current framework document, drawing on lessons learned and focusing on the selection of countries to visit, and the preparation and follow-up to such visits.
10.	In order to enhance transparency, the Chairman of the Committee will hold periodic informal briefings, as appropriate, for Member States on the work of the Committee.

		Facilitating technical assistance to States in a twofold and proactive way

11.	The Committee will complete preparation of its fifth special meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations.
12.	The Committee will conduct thematic discussions on strengthening efforts to limit terrorists’ mobility with the participation of experts from all of the relevant technical international organizations before the fifth special meeting.
13.	The Committee should have a discussion on the functioning and results of the technical assistance work in the Executive Directorate, based on an updated analysis of results. This discussion will focus the work of the Committee towards a results-oriented process.

		Maintaining dialogue with States on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1624 (2005)

14.	On the basis of reports from Member States, the Committee will report to the Council on how States have implemented resolution 1624 (2005). Furthermore, the Committee will continue to encourage States that have still not reported on their implementation of resolution 1624 (2005) to do so. 


		Possible issues to be considered in the future work programme
of the Counter-Terrorism Committee


15.	The Committee should begin discussion on a proposal for a technical guide to resolution 1373 (2001), prepared by the Executive Directorate, that would set out the requirements and necessary steps for implementing the provisions of the resolution and the standards for measuring States’ implementation of that resolution. 
16.	The Committee should develop further the practice of holding informal forums targeting present and potential donors/providers in order to strengthen relations with the donor community.
