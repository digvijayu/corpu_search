Item 3:	ICT and Tourism for Development
3. At its ninth session, the Commission on Enterprise, Business Facilitation and Development decided to convene an Expert Meeting on ICT and Tourism for Development.

4. Tourism is an information-intensive sector and therefore has significantly benefited from ICTs. The distribution of tourism information and products over the Internet is the main area where technological innovation has had the most profound impact on tourism enterprises (producers and distributors). The diffusion of ICTs enables tourism businesses themselves to make tourism products and services directly available to a large number of consumers at relatively low cost, and to interact with them as well as with other tourism producers and distributors. The increasing number of consumers that use the Internet to plan leisure or business trips represents a major incentive for developing countries to organize and develop their tourism offer and its promotion over the Internet. 

5. ICTs are the most effective tools for developing countries to market their tourism offer and increase their customer base. By encouraging the development of e-business practices in the local economy, ICTs make it easier for countries to organize their tourism industry and stimulate cooperation among stakeholders. Despite the challenges posed by the adoption and use of ICTs in developing countries, tourism enterprises with well-conceived websites are given an opportunity to access international tourism markets on an equal footing with competitors from developed countries. The use of ICTs for tourism development is expected to produce economic benefits by generating increased revenue for the local economy and contributing to local development.

6. While a growing number of destination management organizations (DMOs) in developing countries have developed an online presence in the last few years, only a small share have so far been able to offer a fully fledged services web portal in the form of a destination management system (DMS). In order to take full advantage of ICTs and improve their competitiveness in tourism markets, destinations in developing countries have to instill e-business practices effectively among all stakeholders and integrate local tourism providers into DMSs.

7. During the three-day event, experts will learn, through experience sharing and best practices, how to benefit the most from the opportunities offered by ICTs in the tourism industry. They will analyse the process of designing and implementing effective e-tourism strategies and ICT tools from a private and public perspective, based on partnerships among stakeholders in the tourism industry.

8.	In order to facilitate discussion, the secretariat is preparing a background note, which will be circulated as document TD/B/COM.3/EM.25/2. The document will be available on the UNCTAD website www.unctad.org under the heading “Meetings”.
