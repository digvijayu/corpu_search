Item 3:	ICT Solutions to facilitate trade at border crossings and ports

3. The Expert Meeting is being held further to a decision taken by the Commission on Enterprise, Business Facilitation and Development at its tenth session.

4. Recent developments in international trade and transport have led to an increased use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by traders and transport service providers. This has a significant bearing on Customs and other operations at border crossings and in ports. In the context of the Doha Round, Members of the World Trade Organization have now started text-based negotiations on trade facilitation. Possible commitments resulting from these negotiations will invariably be linked to the availability of trade- and transport-related ICT tools in developing countries.

5. ICTs are expected to play an increasing role in the design and implementation of Customs modernization programmes and other trade and transport facilitation measures. ICT applications can reduce waiting times at border crossings and at ports, secure appropriate processing of fees and Customs duties, simplify formalities, and provide timely information to transport operators. The use of ICTs in areas such as Customs automation, electronic documentation and advance information in logistics is likely to continue to grow in coming years. Developing countries must be proactive in reaping full benefits from ICT tools available worldwide to reduce transaction costs and enhance supply capacities.

6. The Expert Meeting will analyse recent trends in the use of ICT in global trade and transport, as well as the resulting requirements for Customs modernization and other trade and transport facilitation measures. These requirements will be related to available ICT tools and their applicability to the realities of developing countries and least developed countries. It will further discuss capacity building and technical assistance requirements to implement specific technology-based trade facilitation measures, including those concerning the institutional, commercial, legal and operational environment for Customs and other operations at border crossings and in ports.

7. To facilitate the discussions, the UNCTAD secretariat has prepared an issues note on ICT Solutions to facilitate trade at border crossings and ports (TD/B/COM.3/EM.27/2). In addition, experts are encouraged to prepare brief papers on the subject under discussion. These papers will be made available at the meeting in the form and language in which they are received.
