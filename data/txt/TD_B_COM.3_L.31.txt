Agenda item 5

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE STRATEGIES FOR DEVELOPMENT

Agreed recommendations*
      
      Recognizing the contribution that the wider adoption and use of ICT and e-business in developing countries can make to the achievement of the international development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and welcoming the initiatives undertaken within the Partnership on ICT for Development in the areas of measuring ICT, free and open source software, and e-tourism, the Commission recommends that UNCTAD should:

      (a)	Carry out research and policy-oriented analytical work on the implications for trade and development of the different aspects of ICT and e-business that fall within UNCTAD's mandate, with a focus on those sectors of main interest for developing countries. Particular attention should be paid to supporting the consideration of the trade and development dimensions of international discussions pertaining to ICT and e-business, including in the contexts of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly to review the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, and WTO;
       
____________________
*	As agreed by the Commission on Enterprise, Business Facilitation and Development at the 	closing plenary meeting of its ninth session on Friday, 25 February 2005.
       
(b)	Continue, with an appropriate implementation strategy, to provide a forum for international discussion and exchange of experiences concerning ICT, e-business and their applications, including dissemination of best practices and standards, in the promotion of trade and development.  In this context, free and open source issues and topics should be incorporated into UNCTAD's contribution to and support for the high-level General Assembly plenary meeting on the Millennium Declaration and WSIS Phase II processes, as well as in contributions to ECOSOC activities and other relevant United Nations bodies considering ICTs in the development context, especially in LDCs;

      (c)	Continue work in the field of the measurement of ICT, including the development of statistical capacity, to enable developing countries to measure the access, use and impact of ICT and to monitor progress in this field. Activities concerning the statistical measurement of ICT should be undertaken in the context of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development that was launched at UNCTAD XI; 

      (d)	Contribute to capacity building in the area of ICT for development, particularly in trade sectors of special interest to developing countries or those that can be more profoundly enhanced through the use of ICT, such as tourism, SME development and poverty alleviation. Such work should address aspects of the identification of specific needs in the area of ICT and e-business, the exchange of experiences and the dissemination of information, and the enhancement of technical and managerial skills and other capacities. Without prejudice to other technology and content models, UNCTAD should provide advisory services to developing countries in the context of its capacity-building activities and the multistakeholder partnerships launched at UNCTAD XI, and facilitate an informed and factual discussion on free and open source software, in partnership with private sector and civil society entities so that they can take advantage of developments in this area.
