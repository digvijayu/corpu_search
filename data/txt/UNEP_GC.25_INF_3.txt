Annex
Issues arising from the resolution of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session

I.	Introduction
      The 63rd Session of the General Assembly adopted between September-December 2008 a total of 266 resolutions, a significant number of which dealt with a diversity of environmental and sustainable development issues many of which are of direct relevance to the programme of work of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The resolutions are particularly relevant in the context of the six cross-cutting thematic priorities identified in the Medium-term Strategy 2010-2013 of the United Nations Environment Programme: environmental governance, ecosystem management, climate change, disasters and conflict, harmful substances and hazardous waste, and resource efficiency and sustainable consumption and production. In addition, the General Assembly also adopted a series of administrative and budgetary resolutions, including the report of the Committee on Programme and Coordination (CPC), recommending the proposed biennial programme of work for 2010-2011.

      Among the resolutions adopted by the 63rd General Assembly are two of direct relevance to UNEP: resolutions 63/220 on the Report of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme on its tenth special session and 63/211 on the Oil slick on Lebanese shores. Many other resolutions acknowledge the work of the United Nations Environment Programme and they include: 63/34 on Cooperation between the United Nations and the Caribbean Community and 63/111 on Oceans and the law of the sea.

      Climate change and natural disasters were some of the issues high on the agenda of the Assembly, with numerous resolutions providing for action to tackle the challenges. For example, the Assembly adopted resolution 63/32 on the protection of global climate for present and future generations, and companion resolutions 63/216, 63/217 and 63/141 on international strategy for disaster reduction, natural disasters and vulnerability, and international cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters respectively. Of major significance in this context is the call by the Assembly for enhanced coordination between adaptation strategies and disasters management strategies.
 
      In terms of codification of international law, the Assembly adopted resolution 63/124: The law of transboundary aquifers, through which it took note of the 19 draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers, presented by the International Law Commission. The draft articles highlight, among others, six general principles, and the protection, preservation and management of transboundary aquifers. 

      In a year in which a diversity of crises such as those on global food prices, fuel and financial, the General Assembly adopted a number of resolutions which stressed the international community’s concerns regarding these crises. In addition to the resolution on the 10th special session of the UNEP GC/GMEF, which highlighted the environmental dimensions of the crises, the Assembly also adopted the resolution on the Doha conference outcome document (resolution 63/239) on financing for development. The issue of financing programmes was a recurrent theme in many other resolutions, for example, in resolution 63/232 on Operational activities for development, the Assembly was concerned at the lack of progress towards greater predictability and adequacy of funding, urging donor countries to substantially increase their voluntary contributions to the core/regular budgets of the United Nations development system, particularly its funds, programmes and specialized agencies, and to contribute on a multi-year basis, in a sustained and predictable manner.

      The Assembly also focused on a diversity of regional issues, adopting many resolutions recognizing the cooperation between the United Nations and various political and regional groupings. A number of the resolutions highlighted environmental issues with some of them acknowledging support by the United Nations Environment Programme. 

      The pace at which the 63rd Session of the General Assembly has conducted business and the diversity of the issues and challenges that it has tackled to the end of December 2008 emphasize the urgency of the international community to try and resolve both longstanding and emerging issues not only of global significance but also national impact. The following sections present relevant General Assembly resolutions in the context of the six cross-cutting thematic priorities identified in the Medium-term Strategy 2010-2013, highlighting not only the diversity and breadth of the issues the General Assembly handled but also their significance to the United Nations Environment Programme. All the 266 resolutions adopted by the General Assembly between September and December 2008 are available at the following GA website: http://www.un.org/ga/63/resolutions.shtml.

II. Resolutions relevant to the UNEP environmental governance subprogramme 
      Resolution 63/220:  Report of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme on its tenth special session – the General Assembly reaffirmed the role of the United Nations Environment Programme as the leading global environmental authority and principal body within the United Nations system in the field of environment, which should take into account, within its mandate, the sustainable development needs of developing countries. It welcomed the continued efforts of UNEP in shifting emphasis from delivery of outputs to achievement of results within its budget and programme of work. In this regard, the Assembly welcomed the UNEP Medium-term Strategy 2010-2013 which is results-based and elaborates six cross-cutting thematic priority areas of work and various means of implementation as a way of strengthening its work, bearing in mind all the relevant provisions of decisions of the Governing Council. It invited partner organizations to cooperate closely with UNEP in implementing its programme of work. The Assembly stressed the need to further advance and fully implement the Bali Strategic Plan for Technology Support and Capacity-building, calling upon Governments and other stakeholders in a position to do so, to provide the necessary funding and technical assistance. The Assembly recognized that the current global crises could adversely impact sustainable development and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and emphasized the need for mobilization of adequate funding to address their environmental aspects. It took note of the findings of the fourth Global Environment Outlook: Environment for Development (GEO-4) that current environmental degradation represents a serious challenge for human well-being and sustainable development. It expressed its deep concern over the evidence of unprecedented environmental changes at all levels, including possible irreversible changes with potentially negative implications for economic and social development, especially for the poor and vulnerable groups in society. The Assembly not only reaffirmed the need to strengthen UNEP’s scientific base, including the reinforcement of the scientific capacity of developing countries, in the area of protection of the environment, including through the provision of adequate financial resources, but also emphasized the importance of building on the experiences gained from the preparation of different global environmental assessments as well as other relevant developments in this field. It reiterated the need for stable, adequate and predictable financial resources for UNEP, and, invited Governments that are in a position to do so, to increase their contributions to the Environment Fund. 

      Resolution 63/212: Implementation of Agenda 21, the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 and the outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development – the Assembly reiterated that sustainable development in its economic, social and environmental aspects is a key element of the overarching framework for United Nations activities. Reaffirming the continuing need to ensure a balance among economic development, social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars of sustainable development, it noted that challenges remain in achieving the goals of the three pillars of sustainable development, particularly in the context of the current global crises. Taking note of the proposal to convene a world summit on sustainable development in 2012 (Rio +20), the General Assembly invited Member States to express their views on the possibility of convening a high-level event on sustainable development. It decided to consider this matter further at the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.  Reiterating that the Commission on Sustainable Development is the high-level body responsible for sustainable development within the United Nations system and serves as a forum for the consideration of issues related to the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, the Assembly encouraged Governments to participate at the appropriate level with representatives, including ministers, from the relevant departments and organizations working in the area of agriculture, rural development, land, drought, desertification and Africa, as well as finance, in the seventeenth session of the Commission and its Intergovernmental Preparatory Meeting. The Assembly encouraged Governments and organizations at all levels, as well as major groups, to undertake results-oriented initiatives and activities to support the work of the Commission and to promote and facilitate the implementation of Agenda 21, the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, including through voluntary multi-stakeholder partnership initiatives. It requested the Secretary-General, in reporting to the Commission at its seventeenth session, on the basis of appropriate inputs from all levels, to submit thematic reports on each of the six issues on agriculture, rural development, land, drought, desertification and Africa, taking into account their interlinkages, while addressing the cross-cutting issues, including means of implementation identified by the Commission at its eleventh session.    

      Resolution 63/213: Follow-up to and Implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States – the Assembly reaffirmed that the adverse effects of climate change and sea-level rise present significant risks to the sustainable development of small island developing States, that the effects of climate change may threaten the very existence of some of them and that adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change and sea-level rise therefore remains a major priority for small island developing States. It recognized the urgent need to increase the level of resources provided to small island developing States for the effective implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation; and underlined the importance of developing and strengthening national sustainable development strategies in small island developing States. The Assembly recalled the decision to review progress made in addressing the vulnerabilities of small island developing States through the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation at the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. The Assembly urged Governments and all relevant international and regional organizations, United Nations funds and programmes, the specialized agencies and regional commissions, international financial institutions and the Global Environment Facility, as well as other intergovernmental organizations and major groups, to take timely action for the effective implementation of and follow-up to the Mauritius Declaration3 and the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation, including the further development and operationalization of concrete projects and programmes. It requested the relevant agencies of the United Nations system, within their respective mandates, to intensify efforts aimed at mainstreaming the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation in their work programmes and to establish a focal point for matters related to small island developing States within their respective secretariats to support coordinated implementation of the Programme of Action at the national, subregional, regional and global levels.

      Resolution 63/214: Towards the sustainable development of the Caribbean Sea for present and future generations – the General Assembly recognized that the Caribbean Sea as an area of unique biodiversity and a highly fragile ecosystem that requires relevant regional and international development partners to work together to develop and implement regional initiatives to promote the sustainable conservation and management of coastal and marine resources, including the consideration of the concept of the Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context of sustainable development, including its designation as such without prejudice to relevant international law. It took note of the efforts of the Caribbean States and the work undertaken by the Commission on the Caribbean Sea of the Association of Caribbean States, including the development of their concept to designate the Caribbean Sea as a special area within the context of sustainable development, and invites the international community to support such efforts. It emphasized that the Caribbean countries have a high degree of vulnerability due to climate change, climate variability and associated phenomena, such as the rise in sea level, the El Niño phenomenon and the increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters caused by hurricanes, floods and droughts, and that they are also subject to natural disasters, such as those caused by volcanoes, tsunamis and earthquakes. The Assembly called upon the United Nations system and the international community to assist, as appropriate, Caribbean countries and their regional organizations in their efforts to ensure the protection of the Caribbean Sea from degradation as a result of pollution from ships, in particular through the illegal release of oil and other harmful substances, and from illegal dumping or accidental release of hazardous waste, including radioactive materials, nuclear waste and dangerous chemicals, in violation of relevant international rules and standards, as well as pollution from land-based activities. The Assembly invited Member States and intergovernmental organizations within the United Nations system to continue their efforts to assist Caribbean countries in becoming parties to the relevant conventions and protocols concerning the management, protection and sustainable utilization of Caribbean Sea resources and in implementing them effectively. 

      Resolution 63/123: Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its sixtieth session – the Assembly expressed its appreciation to the International Law Commission for the work accomplished at its sixtieth session, including the completion of the second reading of the draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers under the topic “Shared natural resources”.  Under a companion resolution 63/124: The law of transboundary aquifers, the Assembly took note of the draft articles on the law of transboundary aquifers, presented by the Commission, and commended them to the attention of Governments without prejudice to the question of their future adoption or other appropriate action. It encouraged the States concerned to make appropriate bilateral or regional arrangements for the proper management of their transboundary aquifers, taking into account the provisions of these draft articles. 

III. Resolutions relevant to the UNEP ecosystem management subprogramme 
      By resolution 63/111: Oceans and the law of the sea, which was adopted by 155 votes, with 1 against and 4 abstentions, the General Assembly highlighted many UNEP activities, including assessments of assessments being coordinated together with the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, and also the regional seas as well as the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities. It stressed the importance of increasing the scientific understanding of the oceans/atmosphere interface, including through participation in ocean observing programmes and geographic information systems, such as the Global Ocean Observing System, a programme of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, particularly considering their role in monitoring and forecasting climate change and variability and in the establishment and operation of tsunami warning systems. It noted with appreciation the work carried out so far and progress made in the “assessment of assessments” by the Group of Experts and the support of the United Nations Environment Programme and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, the lead agencies of the “assessment of assessments”, in providing secretariat services to the Ad Hoc Steering Group and the Group of Experts. The Assembly urged all members of the Ad Hoc Steering Group to participate in the review of the completed “assessment of assessments” report and the summary for decision makers at the meeting of the Steering Group in 2009 and to interact, as appropriate, with the Group of Experts in its deliberations, bearing in mind their respective mandates. It reiterated the need to strengthen the regular scientific assessment of the state of the marine environment in order to enhance the scientific basis for policymaking. The General Assembly reaffirmed the need for States, individually or through competent international organizations, to urgently consider ways to integrate and improve, based on the best available scientific information and the precautionary approach and in accordance with the Convention and related agreements and instruments, the management of risks to the marine biodiversity of seamounts, cold water corals, hydrothermal vents and certain other underwater features. It reaffirmed the need for States to continue and intensify their efforts, directly and through competent international organizations, to develop and facilitate the use of diverse approaches and tools for conserving and managing vulnerable marine ecosystems, including the possible establishment of marine protected areas, consistent with international law, as reflected in the Convention, and based on the best scientific information available, and the development of representative networks of any such marine protected areas by 2012.

      Resolution 63/112: Sustainable fisheries, including through the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, and related instruments – the General Assembly encouraged States to apply the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach in adopting and implementing conservation and management measures addressing, inter alia, by-catch, pollution, overfishing, and protecting habitats of specific concern, taking into account existing guidelines developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It called upon States and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to collect and, where appropriate, report to the FAO required catch and effort data, and fishery related information, in a complete, accurate and timely way, including for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks within and beyond areas under national jurisdiction, discrete high seas fish stocks, and by-catch and discards; and, where they do not exist, to establish processes to strengthen data collection and reporting by members of regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, including through regular reviews of member compliance with such obligations, and, when such obligations are not met, require the member concerned to rectify the problem, including through the preparation of plans of action with timelines. It urged States, either directly or through appropriate global, regional or subregional organizations or arrangements, to intensify efforts to assess and address, as appropriate, the impacts of global climate change on the sustainability of fish stocks and the habitats that support them. On illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the Assembly urged States to exercise effective control over their nationals, including beneficial owners, and vessels flying their flag, in order to prevent and deter them from engaging in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities or supporting vessels engaging in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities, including those vessels listed by regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements as engaged in those activities, and to facilitate mutual assistance to ensure that such actions can be investigated and proper sanctions imposed. On responsible fisheries in the marine ecosystem, the General Assembly urged all States to implement the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities and to accelerate activity to safeguard the marine ecosystem, including fish stocks, against pollution and physical degradation. It requested the relevant parts of the United Nations system, international financial institutions and donor agencies to support increased enforcement and compliance capabilities for regional fisheries management organizations and their member States.

      Resolution 63/219: Convention on Biological Diversity – the General Assembly said it was deeply concerned by the continued loss of biological diversity and the associated decline in the ecosystem services of the planet and their far-reaching environmental, social, economic and cultural impacts and acknowledged that an unprecedented effort was needed to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the rate of loss of biological diversity. It also noted the holding in Putrajaya, Malaysia, from 10 to 12 November 2008, of an ad hoc intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder meeting on an intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services, convened by the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme. The Assembly reaffirmed the commitment, subject to national legislation, to respect, preserve and maintain the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from their utilization. It invited all Member States to create national committees, with participation of representatives of indigenous and local communities, to celebrate the International Year of Biodiversity in 2010, and also invited all international organizations to mark the event. It also decided, as a contribution to the International Year of Biodiversity, to convene at its sixty-fifth session, in 2010, a one-day high-level meeting of the General Assembly, with participation of heads of State, Governments and delegations, taking into consideration the schedule of meetings of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The General Assembly encouraged United Nations departments, funds, programmes, specialized agencies and regional commissions to fully support and participate, as appropriate, in the activities being envisaged for the observance of 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity, under the auspices of the secretariat of the Convention.

      Resolution 63/218: Implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa – the General Assembly emphasized that desertification, land degradation and drought seriously threaten the ability of developing countries to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and recognizing that the timely and effective implementation of the Convention would help to achieve those goals. It reaffirmed its resolve to support and strengthen the implementation of the Convention with a view to addressing causes of desertification and land degradation, as well as poverty resulting from land degradation, through, inter alia, the mobilization of adequate and predictable financial resources, the transfer of technology and capacity-building at all levels. It recognized the potential of the Convention to contribute to addressing global food security, including by preventing land from becoming degraded and mitigating the effects of drought in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, and to create new economic opportunities for enhancing rural development, agricultural productivity and food security for impoverished populations living in those areas. The Assembly invited developed countries that are parties to the Convention and other Governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector and other relevant organizations to make resources available to affected developing countries for the implementation of the ten-year strategic plan and framework to enhance the implementation of the Convention. It invited donors to the Global Environment Facility to ensure that the Facility is adequately resourced during the next replenishment period in order to allow it to allocate sufficient resources to its six focal areas, in particular its land degradation focal area. The Assembly recognized the cross-sectoral nature of desertification, land degradation and drought mitigation, inviting all relevant United Nations agencies to cooperate with the Convention secretariat to support an effective response to desertification and drought.

      Resolution 63/235: Agriculture development and food security – the General Assembly recognized that agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing the needs of a growing global population and is inextricably linked to poverty eradication, especially in developing countries. It stressed that integrated and sustainable agriculture and rural development approaches were, therefore, essential to achieving enhanced food security and food safety in an environmentally sustainable way. It expressed continuing concern that high and volatile food prices and the global food crisis posed a serious challenge to the fight against poverty and hunger, as well as to the efforts of developing countries to attain food security and achieve the objective of reducing by half the number of undernourished people by no later than 2015 as well as other internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. It reiterated that the global food crisis has multiple and complex causes and that its consequences required a comprehensive and coordinated response in the short-, medium- and long-term by national Governments and the international community. The Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report, under the agenda item entitled “Agriculture development and food security”, in close cooperation and coordination with United Nations relevant bodies and organizations, to the General Assembly, at its sixty-fourth session, on national, regional and international efforts within the context of the present resolution.


IV. Resolutions relevant to the UNEP climate change subprogramme 
      Resolution 63/32: Protection of global climate for present and future generations – the General Assembly recognized that climate change posed serious risks and challenges to all countries, particularly to developing countries, especially the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and countries in Africa, including those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. It called upon States to take urgent global action to address climate change in accordance with the principles identified in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and, urged all countries to fully implement their commitments under the Convention, to take effective and concrete actions and measures at all levels, and to enhance international cooperation in the framework of the Convention. The Assembly reaffirmed that efforts to address climate change in a manner that enhances the sustainable development and sustained economic growth of the developing countries and the eradication of poverty should be carried out through promoting the integration of the three components of sustainable development, namely, economic development, social development and environmental protection, as interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars, in an integrated, coordinated and balanced manner. It recognized the need to provide financial and technical resources, as well as capacity-building and access to and transfer of technology, to assist those developing countries adversely affected by climate change; and called upon the international community to fulfill the commitments made during the fourth replenishment of the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund. 

      Resolution 63/215:  International cooperation to reduce the impact of the El Niño phenomenon – the General Assembly reaffirmed the importance of developing strategies at the national, subregional, regional and international levels that aim to prevent, mitigate and repair the damage caused by natural disasters that result from the El Niño phenomenon. It welcomed the activities undertaken so far to strengthen the International Research Centre on El Niño, through collaboration with international monitoring centres, including the national oceanographic institutions, and efforts to enhance regional and international recognition and support for the Centre and to develop tools for decision-makers and Government authorities to reduce the impact of the El Niño phenomenon. It called upon the Secretary-General and the relevant United Nations organs, funds and programmes, particularly those taking part in the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, and the international community to adopt, as appropriate, the necessary measures to strengthen the International Research Centre on El Niño; and invited the international community to provide scientific, technical and financial assistance and cooperation for this purpose, as well as to strengthen, as appropriate, other centres devoted to the study of the El Niño phenomenon. The Assembly underscored the importance of maintaining the El Niño/Southern Oscillation observation system, continuing research into extreme weather events, improving forecasting skills and developing appropriate policies for reducing the impact of the El Niño phenomenon and other extreme weather events, and emphasizes the need to further develop and strengthen these institutional capacities in all countries, particularly in developing countries.


V. Resolutions relevant to the UNEP disasters and conflict subprogramme 

      By resolution 63/211: Oil slick on Lebanese shores, which was adopted by 165 votes with 7 against and 2 abstentions, the General Assembly noted again with great concern the environmental disaster caused by the destruction by the Israeli Air Force on 15 July 2006 of the oil storage tanks in the direct vicinity of El-Jiyeh electric power plant in Lebanon, resulting in an oil slick that covered the entirety of the Lebanese coastline and extended to the Syrian coastline. It considered that the oil slick had heavily polluted the shores of Lebanon and partially polluted Syrian shores and consequently has had serious implications for livelihoods and the economy of Lebanon, owing to the adverse implications for natural resources, biodiversity, fisheries and tourism, and for human health, in the country. The Assembly requested the Government of Israel to assume responsibility for prompt and adequate compensation to the Government of Lebanon and other countries directly affected by the oil slick, such as the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, whose shores had been partially polluted, for the costs of repairing the environmental damage caused by the destruction, including the restoration of the marine environment. The Assembly decided to establish an Eastern Mediterranean oil spill restoration voluntary trust fund, based on voluntary contributions, in order to provide assistance and support to the States directly adversely affected in their integrated environmentally sound management, from clean-up to safe disposal of oily waste of the environmental disaster, and requested the Secretary-General to implement this decision before the end of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. It also invited states, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to make voluntary financial contributions to the trust fund, and, in this regard, requested the Secretary-General to mobilize international technical and financial assistance in order to ensure that the Eastern Mediterranean oil spill restoration voluntary trust fund has sufficient and adequate resources.

      Resolution 63/2:  Outcome document of the midterm review of the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries – the Assembly adopted a “Declaration of the high-level meeting of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly on the midterm review of the Almaty Programme of Action,” which expressed support to those landlocked developing countries that are emerging from conflict, with a view to enabling them to rehabilitate and reconstruct, as appropriate, their political, social and economic infrastructure and assisting them in achieving their development priorities in accordance with the goals and targets of the Almaty Programme of Action, as well as the Millennium Development Goals.

      Resolution 63/51: Observance of environmental norms in the drafting and implementation of agreements on disarmament and arms control – the General Assembly reaffirmed that international disarmament forums should take fully into account the relevant environmental norms in negotiating treaties and agreements on disarmament and arms limitation and that all States, through their actions, should contribute fully to ensuring compliance with the aforementioned norms in the implementation of treaties and conventions to which they are parties.

      By resolution 63/54: Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium – which was adopted by 141 votes with 4 against and 34 abstentions – the General Assembly took into consideration the potential harmful effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the environment, and requested the Secretary-General to ask relevant international organizations to update and complete their studies and research on the issue and to submit a report on the subject to the Assembly’s 65th session. 

      Resolution 63/134: The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts – the Assembly recognized that the trade in conflict diamonds continues to be a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in and proliferation of armaments, especially small arms and light weapons. It noted with satisfaction the publication for the first time of Kimberley Process rough diamond trade and production sub-annual data for 2004 to 2007 and welcomed the progress made towards the collection and submission of complete and accurate statistical reports on the production of and trade in rough diamonds, and encouraged all of the Kimberley Process Participants to continue to enhance the quality of data, and to respond promptly to Process analyses of these data.

      Resolution 63/45: Confidence-building measures in the regional and sub-regional context – the Assembly expressed its conviction that resources released by disarmament, including regional disarmament, could be devoted to economic and social development and to the protection of the environment for the benefit of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries.  In resolution 63/63: Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia – which was adopted by 141 votes with 3 against and 36 abstentions, the Assembly, emphasized the role of a such a zone in promoting cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in the environmental rehabilitation of territories affected by radioactive contamination, and the importance of stepping up efforts to ensure the safe and reliable storage of radioactive waste in the Central Asian States.

      Resolution 63/217: Natural disasters and vulnerability – the General Assembly noted that the global environment continues to suffer degradation, adding to economic and social vulnerabilities, in particular in developing countries, and expressed deep concern at the recent increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and associated natural disasters in some regions of the world and their substantial economic, social and environmental impacts, particularly upon developing countries in those regions. It highlighted the importance of addressing disaster risks related to changing social, economic, environmental conditions and land use, and the impact of hazards associated with geological events, weather, water, climate variability and climate change, in sector development planning and programmes as well as in post-disaster situations. The Assembly encouraged continued and greater support by the international community for adaptation strategies, particularly in countries vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, in order to contribute to disaster management efforts, calling for enhanced coordination between adaptation strategies and disasters management strategies. It encouraged Governments, through their respective International Strategy for Disaster Reduction national platforms and national focal points for disaster risk reduction, in cooperation with the United Nations system, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and other stakeholders, to strengthen capacity-building in the most vulnerable regions, to enable them to address the social, economic and environmental factors that increase vulnerability. The Assembly encouraged the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to continue to assess the adverse effects of climate change on the socio-economic and natural disaster reduction systems of developing countries; and called upon the international community, particularly the developed countries, to provide adequate and predictable resources and access to and transfer of technology, as mutually agreed, to developing countries vulnerable to the adverse effects of natural hazards with a view to enhancing their adaptation capacity.

      Resolution 63/216: International Strategy for Disaster Reduction – the General Assembly expressed its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world and hamper the achievement of their sustainable development, in particular in developing countries. It recognized that certain measures for disaster risk reduction in the context of the Hyogo Framework for Action could also support adaptation to climate change, and emphasizing the importance of strengthening the resilience of nations and communities to natural disasters through disaster risk reduction programmes. The Assembly welcomed the progress made in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action, and stressed the need for a more effective integration of disaster risk reduction into sustainable development policies, planning and programming; for the development and strengthening of institutions, mechanisms and capacities to build resilience to hazards; and for a systematic incorporation of risk reduction approaches into the implementation of emergency preparedness, response and recovery programmes. It highlighted the importance of coordinating adaptation to climate change with relevant disaster risk reduction measures, inviting Governments and relevant international organizations to integrate these considerations in a comprehensive manner into, inter alia development plans and poverty eradication programmes and, in least developed countries, national adaptation programmes of action, and invites the international community to support the ongoing efforts of developing countries in this regard.

      Resolution 63/226: Preventing and combating corrupt practices and transfer of assets of illicit origin and returning such assets, in particular to the countries of origin, consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption – the Assembly recognized that fighting corruption at all levels is a priority and that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and allocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty eradication, the fight against hunger, and economic and sustainable development. It affirmed the need for Member States, consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, to take measures to prevent the transfer abroad and laundering of assets derived from corruption, including to prevent the financial institutions in both countries of origin and destination being used to transfer or receive illicit funds, as well as to assist in their recovery and to return such assets to the requesting State consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption.

      Resolution 63/159: Follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and full implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly – the Assembly called upon Governments, and the relevant funds and programmes, organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system, and invited the international financial institutions and all relevant actors of civil society, including non-governmental organizations, to intensify action to achieve the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome of the twenty-third special session. This includes involving women actively in environmental decision-making at all levels; integrating gender concerns and perspectives in policies and programmes for sustainable development; and strengthening or establishing mechanisms at the national, regional and international levels to assess the impact of development and environmental policies and strategies, including those related to climate change, deforestation and desertification on women; and integrating a gender perspective into the design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting of national environmental policies, strengthening mechanisms and providing adequate resources to ensure women’s full and equal participation in decision-making at all levels on environmental issues, particularly on strategies related to the impact of climate change on the lives of women and girls. 

      In resolution 63/241: The rights of the child – which was adopted by 159 votes and 1 against, the General Assembly expressed profound concern that the situation of children in many parts of the world remained critical as a result of, inter alia, the persistence of poverty, social inequality, inadequate social and economic conditions, pandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, environmental damage and natural disasters. The Assembly urged all States to strengthen the participation of children and adolescents in planning and implementation relating to matters that affect them, such as health, environment, education, social and economic welfare and protection against violence, abuse and exploitation. 

      In resolution 63/176: Globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights – which was adopted by 129 votes with 54 against and 4 abstentions, the Assembly called upon Member States, relevant agencies of the UN system, intergovernmental organizations and civil society to promote equitable and environmentally sustainable economic growth for managing globalization so that poverty is systematically reduced and the international development targets are achieved.

      In resolution 63/178: The right to development – which was adopted by 182 votes with 4 against and 2 abstentions, the Assembly stressed that poverty eradication was one of the critical elements in the promotion and realization of the right to development and that poverty was a multifaceted problem that required a multifaceted and integrated approach in addressing economic, political, social, environmental and institutional dimensions at all levels, especially in the context of the MDGs of halving, by 2015, the proportion of the world’s people whose income was less than one dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.

      In resolution 63/187: The right to food – which was adopted by 184 votes and 1 against, the Assembly recognized the complex character of the worsening of the current global food crisis as a combination of several major factors, including macro-economic, exacerbated by environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of the technology necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States. The Assembly recognized that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources was an increasing challenge for poor producers. It stressed the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation, and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands.

      In resolution 63/189: Promotion of a democratic and equitable international order – which was adopted by 124 votes with 55 against and 7 abstentions, the Assembly recognized the complex character of the worsening of the current global food, fuel and financial crises, in which the adequate enjoyment of all human rights is threatened, as a combination of several major factors, including macro-economic and other factors, such as environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of the technology necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries and least developed countries. The Assembly affirmed that a democratic and equitable international order requires, inter alia, the realization of the right of every person and all peoples to a healthy environment and to enhanced international cooperation that responds effectively to the needs for assistance of national efforts to adapt to climate change, particularly in developing countries, and that promotes the fulfilment of international agreements in the field of mitigation.

      Resolution 63/153: Follow-up to the implementation of the International Year of Volunteers – the Assembly recognized that greater efforts are needed to ensure that climate change and the environment feature on the volunteerism agenda of Governments and the United Nations. 

      Resolution 63/90: International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space – the Assembly underlined that it was convinced that the use of space science and technology and their applications in such areas as telemedicine, tele-education, disaster management and environmental protection as well as other Earth observation applications contributed to achieving the objectives of the global conferences of the UN that addressed various aspects of economic, social and cultural development, particularly poverty eradication. The Assembly urged entities of the UN system, particularly those participating in the Inter-Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities, to examine how space science and technology and their applications could contribute to implementing the UN Millennium Declaration, and encouraged the UN University and other scientific institutions to explore the possibilities of providing training and policy research at the crossroads of international law, climate change and outer space.

      In resolution 63/103: Implementation of the Declaration of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations – which was adopted by 125 votes with 55 abstentions, the Assembly noted the extremely fragile economies of the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories and their vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones and sea-level rise; and requested the specialized agencies and other organizations of the UN system to provide information on, among other things: environmental problems facing the territories; the impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes and volcanic eruptions, and other environmental problems, such as beach and coastal erosion and droughts, on those territories; and the illegal exploitation of the marine resources of the Territories and the need to utilize those resources for the benefit of the peoples of the territories.

      Resolution 63/106: Question of New Caledonia – the Assembly noted the importance of the positive measures being pursued in the territory by the French authorities, in cooperation with all sectors of the population, to promote political, economic and social development, including measures in the area of environmental protection. It noted the continuing strengthening of ties between New Caledonia and both the European Union and the European Development Fund in such areas as economic and trade cooperation, the environment, climate change and financial services.  It also noted the positive initiatives aimed at protecting the natural environment of the territory, notably the “Zonéco” operation designed to map and evaluate marine resources within the economic zone of the Territory.

      Resolution 63/108:Questions of American Samoa, Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guam, Montserrat, Pitcairn, Saint Helena, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States Virgin Islands – the Assembly, conscious of the particular vulnerability of the territories to natural disasters and environmental degradation, requested the territories and the administering powers to take all necessary measures to protect and conserve the environment of the territories against any degradation, and once again requested the specialized agencies concerned to continue to monitor environmental conditions in those territories.

      Resolution 63/135: Sport as a means to promote education, health, development and peace – the Assembly invited Member States, the organizations of the United Nations system, including their governing bodies, international peacekeeping missions, sport-related organizations, athletes, the media, civil society and the private sector to collaborate with the United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace to promote greater awareness and action to foster peace and accelerate the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals through sport-based initiatives and promote the integration of sport for development and peace in the development agenda.

I.	Introduction

1.	The triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system was undertaken by the General Assembly at its sixty-second session, and led to the adoption of resolution 62/208 on 19 December 2007.

2.	To ensure follow-up to the resolution, the General Assembly requested the Secretary General to submit a proposal, for consideration by the ECOSOC, identifying an appropriate management process for the full implementation of the resolution 62/208. The Assembly also requested the governing bodies of the funds, programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations development system to take appropriate actions for the full implementation of resolution 62/208, and called upon the executive heads of those organizations to submit a yearly progress report to their governing bodies on measures taken and envisaged for the implementation of the resolution for the triennial comprehensive policy review.

3.	The ECOSOC, during its substantive session of 2008, approved the management process proposed by the Secretary General, as contained in document E/2008/49, which provides a comprehensive programme of work for the full implementation of the resolution 62/208 and serves as the basis for progress reporting to ECOSOC in 2009 and 2010 by the Secretary General.

4.	The present report has been prepared, pursuant to the General Assembly request, to provide the Governing Council and Global Ministerial Environment Forum (GC/GMEF) with a synopsis of the measures taken and progress made by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in the implementation of the management process for the implementation of the resolution 62/208. As a non-resident agency, UNEP’s follow up in this regard has primarily taken place in the context of its membership in the UNDG and its currently limited but progressively increasing involvement in the CCA/UNDAF processes. Consequently, the report contains UNEP’s activities in relation to those policy directives of the management process that have direct relevance to UNEP’s operational role and engagements in the above context.


II.	Overall approach to the role and functioning of the United Nations system’s development cooperation in support of national development priorities and strategies of programme countries and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals.

Policy Direction: Coordination at country level to recognize respective organizations mandates and roles and enhance the effective utilization of their resources and expertise (see para. 13 of the resolution)

5.	As part of the United Nations reform and the “delivering as one” efforts, the UNEP’s collaboration with the United Nations family at the country level has been strengthened through active engagement in the eight One UN pilots. UNEP is increasingly involved in United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) processes and, with the support of the resident coordinators and UN Country Teams (UNCTs), contributes to the development of the One UN programmes and UNDAFs. As a result, some of UNEP’s country activities have been better incorporated into these frameworks.  

6.	UNCTs have increasingly acknowledged the wide range of expertise that UNEP could bring to the country programming processes and UNEP is increasingly being asked to take the lead in efforts to mainstream environmental sustainability in these processes. However, UNEP still faces a number of challenges as a non-resident agency, such as the following, which must be overcome for effective utilization of UNEP’s expertise for supporting national development programmes:

* UNEP is not always considered part of the “core UNCT” and often faces fait accompli situations which have implications on its contribution to the “delivering as one” process. 
* Differences in UNCT programming cycles, pace of operations, administrative and financial management procedures continue to pose challenges to UNEP’s effective country-level engagement.
* In some cases, UNEP and other non-resident agencies are not encouraged to participate in the One UN programme nor have access to the One UN Fund.
* Balancing the need to ensure broader, more substantive and coherent UNEP input to UNCT processes and programmes with existing internal capacities to deliver on the expectations emerging from UNEP’s engagement with the UNCT.
* Limited understanding within some UNCTs of structures and operations of non-resident agencies such as UNEP which often places unrealistic expectations on the ability of non-resident agencies to fully engage in UNCT processes.

7.	Despite these challenges, UNEP is very actively involved in common country planning and joint programming in a number of countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and West Asia (see paragraphs 14 to 17 for details). 


III.	Funding for operational activities for development of the United Nations system

Policy Direction: Organizations to address the imbalance between core and non-core resources

8.	The Environment Fund (EF) and the UN Regular Budget constitute UNEP’s core sources of funding with the EF, which is made up of voluntary contributions from member states, accounts for more than 90% of the core resources and constitute the primary resource base of UNEP’s programme of work approved by the GC/GMEF. 

9.	Consequently, UNEP has undertaken measures addressing three main areas to improve the predictability and increase the level of contribution to the EF. Firstly, UNEP has introduced a voluntary indicative scale of contributions (VISC) to stimulate and suggest member states to provide funding to the EF commensurate with their respective economic and social circumstances. Secondly, UNEP has worked very closely with member states beyond the traditional donors towards broadening the donor base. Finally, UNEP has taken steps to encourage member states, on a selective basis, to pay their additional contributions to the EF instead of earmarking, through working with member states and identifying their funding preferences and matching such with UNEP programme priorities and objectives. As a result of these combined efforts, about US$ 89 million in pledges and contributions to the EF were received in 2008 with the total projected contributions for 2008-2009 may reach US$ 168 million compared to the GC/GMEF approved biennial budget of US$ 152 million. While not all states can make regular annual contributions, there are over 150 countries that have pledged or contributed to the EF during recent years. In 2008, 95 member states, which include developing countries and countries with economies in transition, contributed to the EF and at least 60 of them with higher level of contribution compared to the previous year.

10.	As with other UN entities, UNEP has increasingly become dependent on extra-budgetary (non-core) resources to supplement the EF resources for implementing the programme of work. In order not to be driven by programmatic preference of donors but to reap the full benefit of their support, UNEP has initiated a multi-donor partnership programming process that takes a programmatic approach to securing the donor funding and establishing a multi-year financial framework in support of selected priority areas within the approved programme of work. Consequently, UNEP currently boasts a multi-donor annual partnership portfolio valued approximately at US$ 35 million, which directly supports the implementation of the GC/GMEF approved programme of work. Most recently, within the framework of the multi-donor partnership programming process, UNEP held several donor consultations, including with Belgium, China, the Nordic countries, Spain and United Kingdom to explore new opportunities and strategies to further support its core programme of work from non-core resources.


IV.	Contribution of United Nations operational activities to national capacity development and development effectiveness 
    
A.	Capacity-building and development 

Policy Direction: The United Nations system to develop capacity of developing countries to coordinate and evaluate the impact of external development assistance (see para. 37 of the resolution); to support the development of frameworks to enable countries design, monitor and evaluate results in capacity development (see para. 38 of the resolution); and to create and report on results framework to measure capacity-building initiatives and activities of the United Nations (see para. 42 of the resolution).

11.	UNEP’s engagement in the One UN pilots and UNDAF processes has led to a shift in approach for its capacity building activities at the national level. UNEP’s intended interventions are increasingly being incorporated in the One UN Programmes and Common Country Assessments (CCAs)/UNDAFs. These interventions are at higher levels of aggregations and will be further elaborated when the UNDAFs are translated into specific joint programmes and workplans.

Policy Direction: The United Nations organizations to adopt measures that ensure sustainability in capacity-building activities (see para. 39 of the resolution); to use, to the fullest extent possible, national execution and national expertise/technologies as the norm to implement operational activities (see para. 39 of the resolution); and to strengthen and progressively rely on national procurement systems (see para. 41 of the resolution)

12.	UNEP, while traditionally a normative organization, has a mandate for capacity building and technology support under its Bali Strategic Plan for Technology Support and Capacity Building. Operational activities of UNEP are currently being reviewed in light of inter-agency simplification and harmonization attempts. To this end UNEP has hired two specialist staff familiar with Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer and will train other staff at country level in Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer as part of its corporate training strategy.

Policy Direction: Funds, programmes and specialized agencies to intensify collaboration at the country and regional levels in strengthening national capacities (see para. 43 of the resolution)

13.	UNEP is increasingly involved in UN common country planning and joint programming processes,  with the support of the resident coordinators and UNCTs, thus UNEP capacity-building activities are being better incorporated in UNDAFs and One UN programmes. 

14.	In Africa, UNEP is actively involved in UN common country planning in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Tanzania; and involved in joint programming activities in Botswana, Cape Verde, Namibia, Mozambique and Senegal. Arrangements are being made to undertake a review of UNDAFs in Africa with regard to the inclusion of environmental dimensions in the UNDAFs.

15.	In Asia and the Pacific, UNEP is actively involved in UN common country planning activities in Bhutan, Laos, and Viet Nam; and arrangements are underway in the Philippines and Pakistan to provide, inter alia, secretariat support to the joint UN Theme Group on the Environment and to the pilot One UN initiative, respectively. UNEP has appointed a UNEP Regional UNDAF Coordinator to strengthen its capacity to support the UNDAF preparation in all 2009 roll-out countries. It is envisaged for UNEP to participate in each UNDAF prioritization workshop at country level. 

16.	In Europe, UNEP participated in the UNDAF development process in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Serbia ensuring the incorporation of environmental dimension in the draft UNDAF documents. UNEP also has been working closely with the Resident Coordinator and UNDP, in Turkey in supporting the climate change adaptation project activities funded by the MDG Achievement Fund. Furthermore, UNEP is strongly involved in the Albania “delivering as one” pilot and continues to lead the environment cluster, in which UNDP, UNICEF, UNESCO and UNFPA are represented.

17.	In Latin America and the Caribbean, UNEP takes part in UNDAFs in several countries and contributes to various components, encompassing e. g. water and sanitation in Brazil, in Cuba, inter alia, energy and in Mexico natural resources and energy, etc. In addition, UNEP currently contributes to the formulation of the UNDAFs in Ecuador, Guatemala and Haiti and expect to extend its support to UNDAF in Panama upon completion of the next annual review. Furthermore, UNEP co-chairs the UNDAF Working Group on the Results Matrix 2: Human Rights, which includes the area of environmental sustainability. UNEP also participates in the MDG Achievement Fund joint programmes as an executing agency under the “environment and climate change” theme in Nicaragua, Panama and Peru. UNEP is also actively involved in the “delivering as one” Pilot Uruguay and will execute two joint projects under the Coherence Fund in areas of environmental indicators, and sustainable consumption and production, respectively. These engagements have resulted in raising UNEP profile among national governments in the region as well as the sister agencies thus increasing their support for UNEP participation in joint activities and funding for UNEP projects. In West Asia, UNEP was involved in UNDAF drafting process in Lebanon.

B.	South-South Cooperation and development of national capacities

Policy Direction: Funds, programmes, specialized agencies and other entities of the United Nations system to mainstream support to South-South and triangular cooperation (see para. 48 of the resolution)

18.	UNEP’s broad strategic approach to operationalization of south-south cooperation as a key mechanism for the delivery of capacity building and technology support entails liaising and consulting with the UNDP Special Unit for South-South Cooperation, other UN agencies, relevant Multilateral Environmental Agreement  Secretariats, regional cooperation mechanisms and on-going South-South Cooperation initiatives. The aim is to establish strategic partnerships, develop joint activities and synergies in advancing south-south cooperation in support of UNEP’s capacity building efforts in the context of the Bali Strategic Plan for Technology Support and Capacity Building.  This also entails innovative approaches and opportunities to catalyse complementary funding support for the identified activities. UNEP’s evolving engagement and integration of its interventions in UNCT processes will endeavour to elaborate where appropriate capacity building activities that can be delivered using south-south cooperation modalities.

C.	Gender mainstreaming

Policy Direction: The United Nations development system to mainstream a gender perspective and to pursue gender equality and the empowerment of women in country programmes, planning instruments and sector-wide programmes and to articulate specific country-level goals and targets (see para. 56 of the resolution); and the governing bodies to ensure that gender perspectives are integrated into all aspects of their monitoring functions (see para. 57 of the resolution)

19.	In order to ensure that all UNEP programme and project activities are gender responsive, Gender Action Plans for divisions consistent with their respective programmatic requirements have been developed and are in use. Furthermore, over 480 of UNEP staff have been trained to-date on mainstreaming gender into programmes and projects; and additional training sessions to continue through out 2009. To provide close guidance and assistance to divisions in the integration of gender perspectives in programmes and projects, gender focal teams have been established by drawing and training about 80 staff from all UNEP offices. It is evident from UNEP project documents that these efforts have resulted in an increase in the integration of gender into programme and project development processes.

Policy Direction: The United Nations development system to enhance the effectiveness of gender specialist resources, gender focal points, gender theme groups (see para. 60 of the resolution)

20.	UNEP established a Senior Gender Advisor position located within the Executive Direction and Management; and the position was filled in July 2008.  At the divisional level gender focal teams were developed with a total of 80 staff drawn from all UNEP offices to form these focal teams, which assist in division level capacity building on gender mainstreaming. In addition, Gender Action Plans for divisions, harmonized with their respective programmatic requirements, have been developed to ensure that all UNEP projects and activities are gender responsive. The capacity building of the gender focal teams, with a particular focus on their respective subprogrammes, will continue in 2009.

Policy Direction: Organizations of the United Nations development system to continue efforts to achieve gender balance in appointments within the United Nations system for positions that affect operational activities for development, including appointments of resident coordinators and other high-level posts (see para. 66)

21.	UNEP gives serious considerations to achieving gender balance in recruitment and has taken several extra-ordinary measures to achieve this objective. These include the appointment in 2008 of the Senior Gender Adviser as the focal point for women in accordance with ST/SGB/2008/12. The Senior Gender Advisor has the responsibility, among others, to ensure that a gender balance is maintained in recruitment of staff to both professional and general service categories; the development of a roster of qualified women to take up posts from P4 to D2 levels; and advertising vacancy announcement in networks that have more female members to seek out qualified women for professional positions. 

22.	UNEP has made significant progress and of the professional staff appointments made during the period 2007-2008, 46% were female. At present, UNEP has a 18% representation of women in the principal officer (D2 and D1) category.

D.	Transition from relief to development

Policy Direction: The United Nations system to contribute to the development of national capacities to manage the transition process (see para. 67 of the resolution); and to tailor support to country-specific needs and to effectively support early recovery (see paras. 70 and 78 of the resolution) 

The United Nations system organizations to support national capacity-building efforts and report on their activities to their respective governing bodies (see para. 72 of the resolution); and to begin planning the transition to development and taking measures supportive of that transition from the beginning of the relief phase (see para. 81 of the resolution)

23.	UNEP focuses its effort in strengthening the capacities of Governments and other stakeholders to mainstream best practices in natural resources management into national development processes and for the restoration of degraded ecosystems. Through its post-crisis environmental recovery programmes, UNEP has continued to provide capacity-building and institutional development support and environmental expertise to UNCTs and resident coordinators in post-crisis countries including Afghanistan, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Myanmar, Rwanda and Sudan; and taken an active role in the development of UNDAF and other country programming processes. 

24.	Upon request from national governments or UNCTs, UNEP develops early recovery programmes that aim to strengthen the capacity of environmental authorities, rehabilitate ecosystems, mitigate risks and ensure that resources are used in a sustainable manner within reconstruction and development processes. In 2008 for example, UNEP provided post-disaster early recovery support to China and Myanmar in the aftermath of major disasters in the two countries. In addition, UNEP took part in the UN and World Bank post-disaster needs assessment in Haiti, which led to the launch of a recovery appeal. As part of the Inter Agency Standing Committee Working Group on Early Recovery, UNEP mobilized resources and expertise to respond to several crisis situations, including the 2008 conflict in Georgia and the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza

25.	At the request of UNDG, UNEP has worked in close collaboration with the World Bank to develop guidance on the integration of environmental needs in post-conflict needs assessments. This guidance has been supplemented with an environment and conflict analysis framework and resource-based indicators for natural resource management in post-conflict countries. The methodology which is under final review will be finalized in 2009. Likewise, in the capacity of the focal point for the environment within the Inter Agency Standing Committee Cluster Working Group on Early Recovery, UNEP developed an environmental assessment module for the post-disaster needs assessment framework. The methodology was field-tested in 2008. On the ground, UNEP provided technical assistance as part of the UN and World Bank post-conflict joint needs assessments conducted in Georgia and Haiti in 2008 to assess the potential impacts of those conflicts on the environment..

Policy Direction: Strengthen interdepartmental and inter-agency coordination (see para. 71), including improved coordination and joint response by the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions (see para. 73 of the resolution)

26.	Principal to UNEP strategy in post conflict and post disaster interventions is to work within the framework of UN coordinated efforts. UNEP is an active member of inter-agency fora at the international level such as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Cluster Working Group on Early Recovery; as well as at the country level, including UNCTs in Afghanistan, Rwanda and Sudan, where UNEP acts as the focal point for environment. In addition, UNEP collaborated with a number of other UN agencies to develop an inter-agency project with the European Commission on “Strengthening National Capacities for the Consensual and Sustainable Management of Land and Natural Resources”. UNEP’s role in the project, which commenced in late 2008, is to identify best practices, provide training to UNCTs, and conduct environment and conflict analysis. 

27.	UNEP has worked in close collaboration with the World Bank to develop guidance on the integration of environmental needs in post-conflict needs assessments. The methodology is currently undergoing final review towards finalization. UNEP has also collaborated with the World Bank on the ground, as part of the UN and World Bank post-conflict joint needs assessments conducted in Georgia in September 2008 and in Haiti in October 2008.

Policy Direction: Improve the effectiveness of resource mobilization for transition from relief to development (see para. 75 of the resolution)

28.	UNEP works together with national governments and partner agencies to mobilize funding for early recovery programmes that address environmental issues, mitigate risks and ensure that resources are used in a sustainable manner within reconstruction and development processes. For example, through UNEP’s efforts in coordinating the international environmental response to the May 2008 earthquake in China, nearly US$ 6 million was requested for environmental recovery in the appeal launched by the UN in July 2008. Domestic funding for addressing environmental needs in the recovery process has also been secured through UNEP’s support to the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection.  

29.	UNEP has also mobilized funds to respond to several crisis situations as part of the Inter Agency Standing Committee Working Group on Early Recovery. At country level, UNEP has worked to improve timeliness and appropriateness of funding for early recovery as part of UNCTs in Afghanistan and Sudan.

Policy Direction: Harmonize data collection and information management during the transition phase; make information available to Member State concerned (see para. 77 of the resolution)

30.	The coordination of data collection by UN agencies and partners is under the purview of UNDG and UNEP remains available to provide environmental data, analysis and expertise on environmental issues to partner agencies and wider UN processes. In 2008, for example, UNEP conducted a desk study on environment and natural resources in the Central African Republic as part of its contribution towards the UN system post-conflict planning processes in the Republic.

Policy Direction: The resident coordinator system and the United Nations county teams to promote the inclusion of prevention strategies in national development plans (see para. 84 of the resolution); and the relevant United Nations organizations to integrate disaster risk reduction (DRR) into their respective activities (see para. 85 of the resolution)

31.	In response to Policy Committee decision 2007/19 to further mainstream disaster risk reduction and the Hyogo Framework of Action into UN system policies and practices, the UNDG Working Group on Programming Issues (WGPI) and the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction set up a joint task team in 2008. A Guidance Note on integrating disaster risk reduction into CCAs and UNDAFs has been developed in close collaboration with UNCTs and together with a corresponding roll-out strategy approved by the disaster risk reduction task team as well as by the WGPI. UNEP co-chaired the UNDG disaster risk reduction task team that has produced this Guidance Note which is intended to support UNCTs embarking on or reviewing their CCAs and UNDAFs in countries where disaster risk constitutes an important challenge to national development and poverty reduction. Because of the close relationship between disaster and climate change the guidance note is also anticipated to be relevant to the work in the area of climate change. The wider development community may also benefit from its insights on integrating disaster risk reduction into broader development analysis, strategic planning and programming. 

V.	Improved functioning of the United Nations development system

A.	Coherence, relevance and effectiveness 

Policy Direction: The United Nations system to use UNDAF and its results matrix as the common programming tool for country-level contributions of the funds and programmes towards the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals (see para. 86 of the resolution); and the United Nations system to fully utilize opportunities (based on UNDAF) for joint initiatives and joint programming (see para. 87 of the resolution)

32.	As part of the UN reform and the “delivering as one” efforts, UNEP’s collaboration with the UN family has been strengthened at the country level through active engagement in the eight One UN pilots. UNEP is also increasingly involved in UNDAF processes in all regions. The implementation of UNEP’s programme of work activities at the country level will be guided by and aligned to the UNDAFs in order to better respond to the identified national priorities. 

Policy Direction: The United Nations system to provide further financial, technical and organizational support for the resident coordinator system (see para. 92 of the resolution)

33.	UNEP focuses on strengthening its capacity to ensure effective participation in the resident coordinator system and UNDAF processes. It also supports UN resident agencies with their efforts to mainstream environmental sustainability into their operations. 
34.	In May 2008 in Nairobi, Kenya, a workshop on environmental sustainability and UN country programming was held for UNEP staff. During 2009, UNEP intends to develop and conduct training courses on mainstreaming environmental sustainability for UN teams in countries in Asia and Pacific; and will continue to provide inputs to UNDAF process in that region. UNEP, in collaboration with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, will pilot a framework that has been designed for use by country processes for preparation of national environmental summaries. In Latin America and the Caribbean, UNEP actively participates in the work of the UNCTs particularly in Brazil, Mexico, Panama and Uruguay; and contribute to their UNDAF processes. In Panama, UNEP’s contributions included the Greening the Office Programme of the Sustainable United Nations Initiative. In West Asia, UNEP has been working closely with the UNCT in Bahrain. In addition, areas of cooperation have been identified and working arrangements have been established with the resident coordinator systems and UNCTs in Jordan and Lebanon.

Policy Direction: The Secretary-General to improve the transparency and competitiveness of the recruitment process for senior high-level posts in the United Nations system, and through CEB, to harmonize recruitment processes for senior officials by 2009 (see para. 102 of the resolution)

35.	UNEP has taken significant steps to improve its recruitment practices at the senior level with targeted outreach activities, which takes into account gender and geographical considerations, mandatory telephone interviews, face-to-face interviews for the final short-listed candidates, written assessment, personality assessment and through reference checks. The improved procedures and processes have had an overall positive impact on recruitment practices in the organization

Policy Direction: The strategic plans of funds and programmes should be guided by the comprehensive policy review (see para. 97 of the resolution)

36.	UNEP actively participates in the inter-agency Strategic Planning Network, which reflects on the implications of the triennial comprehensive policy review across UN entities. UNEP’s Programme of Work 2010-2011 reflects the key issues of the 2007 Triennial Comprehensive Policy Review.

Policy Direction: Programme countries should have access to the full range of resources of the United Nations system (see para. 101 of the resolution)

37.	UNEP actively participates in UN Common Country Programming Processes, both at country level, as well as part of the regional Quality Support & Assurance functions. Although the 2007 Non-resident Agency Implementation Plan preceded UNEP’s planned and structured engagement in UNCT processes, UNEP has nonetheless provided and continues to provide support to UNCTs in all regions. 

38.	UNEP also seek to align and integrate its country level activities with UNDAF processes, where relevant. The integration of UNEP’s interventions in UNCT processes implies making available, to the UNCT and national partners, the full range of UNEP expertise and resources as they relate to the requirements of these interventions. In order to inform countries and UNCTs of the expertise and services available, UNEP disseminates information on (i) its available expertise and resources, and comparative advantage and potential value added to the work of UNCTs; and (ii) its experience in participation in CCA and UNDAF preparatory processes and reviews, in particular the integration of environmental sustainability in UNDAFs, joint programmes and workplans.

B.	Regional dimensions

Policy Direction: Entities of the United Nations system at the regional level to intensify their cooperation and coordination (see paras. 108, 110 of the resolution); Regional Commissions to further develop their analytical capacities to support country-level development initiatives and more intensive inter-agency collaboration at the regional and subregional levels (see para. 108 of the resolution); The United Nations development system to intensify cooperation with regional and subregional intergovernmental organizations and regional banks (see paras. 107, 110 of the resolution); and Align regional technical support structures and the regional bureaux and identify appropriate mechanisms at the subregional level, where appropriate (see para. 109 of the resolution)

39.	UNEP is an active member of the Regional Directors Teams for Eastern and Southern Africa, Western and Central Africa, Asia and the Pacific, West Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. UNEP actively reviews and provides inputs to draft CCAs and UNDAFs through the regional Quality Support and Assurance teams; and in some cases serve as the lead agency in UNDAF roll-out peer support teams in these regions.  

40.	In addition, UNEP works very closely with other UN organizations and participates in numerous inter-agency mechanisms in delivering its mandated work programme. Few examples demonstrating UNEP’s intense cooperation with regional commissions and development banks are as follows: In the area of disaster management and post-crisis recovery, UNEP is a member of the regional coordination mechanism in Asia and the Pacific and co-chairs the thematic working group on environment and disaster management together with ESCAP and OCHA. It is also an important member in UN and World Bank post-disaster needs assessment operations world-wide. UNEP works jointly with ESCAP and the Asian Development Bank on the preparation of the Asia Pacific State of the Environment Report and is a key partner in the organization of the 2010 Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development in Asia and the Pacific. Likewise, UNEP, UNDESA and ESCAP are jointly hosting the 4th International Expert Meeting on Sustainable Consumption and Production. UNEP is working with ECLAC to develop guidelines for reporting on the progress of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goal on environmental sustainability; and spearheading the implementation of the Sustainable United Nations Initiative in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Furthermore, UNEP is working with Inter-American Development Bank to mobilize GEF funding to support the establishment of wastewater treatment facilities and services in the wider Caribbean region. Local authorities of countries around the world and UNEP and UNDP have formed an alliance, through signing of a letter of intent in Saint Malo, France in October 2008, to address the challenges of the climate change with a focus on Carbon Neutrality and Climate change resilient territories. Furthermore, UNEP and UNIDO are promoting the transition towards renewable energy in the European region including the networking between European Union and non-European Union countries to share experiences in harnessing the potential of renewable sources of energy. UNEP is also expected to play a role in the Climate Investment Funds administered by the World Bank.

C.	Transaction costs and efficiency

Policy Direction: Continue to develop harmonized approaches (see para. 121 of the resolution)

41.	In the context of One UN pilots and “delivering as one”, UNEP has initiated internal change management discussions and process in order to better respond to the demands of country level engagement and the work of the UNCTs, as a non-resident agency.

42.	With regard to harmonization of finance and audit practices and the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, UNEP’s preparation is guided by the time table managed by the UN Secretariat. However, to provide necessary coordination and support for the implementation of IPSAS and ERP, the agencies headquartered in Nairobi duty station have initiated an inter-agency working group.

Policy Direction: Reduce United Nations overhead and transaction costs for national Governments (see paras. 118 and 120 of the resolution)

43.	UNEP has entered into a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with UNDP that rationalizes UNEP’s presence in country and simplifies interaction with national stakeholders. To facilitate MoU implementation, common business processes between UNEP and UNDP have been identified and services have been agreed upon.

D.	Country-level capacity of the United Nations development system

Policy Direction: United Nations staff to have the skills and expertise for effective management, policy advisory and other capacity development work (see para. 124 of the resolution); and the United Nations to adopt comprehensive policies and strategies for human resources and workforce planning and development and, in this regard, the Secretary-General to report on identifying human resource challenges at the country level (see para. 125 of the resolution)

44.	Plans are underway at UNEP to conduct a gap analysis on the human recourses capacity of the organization in light of the programmatic and other administrative requirements. The outcome of this analysis will constitute the basis for the realignment exercise to take place in the organization in 2009, including provision of training and learning opportunities to existing staff, review of skills required in new staff intake and in possible separation of staff whose skills no longer are required within the organization. 

45.	UNEP is also undertaking a review of the application of the performance appraisal system in the organization with a view to improve its implementation and ensure consistency. It is also expected that this review will provide useful inputs to the realignment exercise planned for 2009

Policy Direction: Intensify efforts related to inter-agency staff mobility, re-profiling and redeployment of staff, as well as training and skills upgrading (see para. 126 of the resolution)

46.	UNEP is in the final stages of developing its training and learning framework and detailed training plan for staff. UNEP will make use of courses offered by UN Office of Human Resource Management and United Nations System Staff College; and endeavor to develop its own internal training capacity. 

47.	As the vast majority of UNEP staff is funded from resources other than the United Nations Regular Budget, they were not considered for participation in the UN Secretariat managed reassignment programme. UNEP, therefore, has launched its own Pilot Voluntary Rotation Programme for its staff. In addition, UNEP will continue to seek to provide other career development opportunities for its staff and will endeavor, among other initiatives, on developing modalities and a formal programme for staff exchange with other UN agencies, programmes and funds.

E.	Evaluation of operational activities for development

Policy Direction: Strengthen evaluation activities across the United Nations development system with focus on results (see paras. 132, 138); develop further guidance and oversight mechanisms for assessing UNDAFs (see para. 136); promote a culture of evaluation (see para. 138 of the resolution)

48.	UNEP has a distinct evaluation function located within Executive Direction and Management, hence it is independent of the substantive programmes (subprogrammes) and has relative independence to conduct evaluations. UNEP evaluations are guided by the United Nations Evaluation Group norms and standards and the evaluation approach focuses largely on results. 

49.	As required by the Results Based Management approach within the UN Secretariat, self-assessments are conducted by respective subprogrammes to ascertain the achievement of expected subprogramme results. These self-assessments, in turn, provide vital inputs into evaluation of the overall performance and impact of UNEP’s subprogrammes. UNEP’s Evaluation and Oversight Unit is responsible for conducting subprogramme evaluations as well as evaluation of other cross-cutting issues not specific to a subprogramme. 

50.	Even though UNEP is not a resident agency at the country level, it has been active in the interagency working group to manage and conduct evaluability assessments of the “delivering as one” processes under the auspices of the United Nations Evaluation Group. UNEP served on the Management Board for the evaluation and provided the lead in conducting an evaluability assessment of the “delivering as one” pilots in Tanzania.
