  Report of the Secretary-General 
 
 
 

 Summary 
 In its resolution 63/262 (sect. IV, para. 11), the General Assembly decided not 
to approve the proposal of the Secretary-General for a new secondary data centre as a 
result of the unsuitability of the proposed Long Island City site (see A/62/477) and 
requested the Secretary-General to report at the first part of its resumed sixty-third 
session on the risk mitigation measures to be taken during the relocation of the 
primary data centre to the North Lawn. In the same resolution, the Assembly 
requested the Secretary-General to present a new proposal for a secondary data 
centre, including a proposal on cost-sharing arrangements (sect. IV, para. 19). 

 The present report responds to the above decisions of the General Assembly 
and addresses the request of the Assembly to the Secretary-General to consolidate 
systems in central data centres in order to strengthen disaster recovery and business 
continuity (resolution 63/262, sect. IV, para. 2). 

 In the context of the present report, the Secretary-General proposes that the 
Secretariat lease a commercial data centre facility, starting 1 July 2009, and obtain 
the services of the International Computing Centre, which would install new 
information and communications technology (ICT) equipment in this ready-to-use 



A/63/743

facility, and migrate all systems from the current secondary data centre in the DC2 
Building to the leased facility by 1 November 2009, in time to provide a reliable 
backup during the relocation of the primary data centre. The Secretariat is to retain 
the data centre in the DC2 Building in working condition throughout the move in 
order to mitigate the risk of disruption to ICT services and the impact on the 
construction schedule of the capital master plan. The duration of the lease of the new 
facility is intended to run from 1 July 2009 to December 2011. This option of leasing 
a commercial data centre facility also allows for flexibility in adjusting to changes in 
scope and offers, under the present conditions, a viable solution for the secondary 
data centre for United Nations Headquarters in the short term. 

 The resources required for the new secondary data centre comprise: (a) a 
non-recurrent requirement related to the setting up of the new systems, (b) recurrent 
expenditures for managing the data centre operations, including equipment and 
related maintenance, and (c) recurrent expenditures for the lease of the facility, 
including power and cooling. The total costs, estimated in the amount of 
$25,737,500, are to be cost-shared between the programme budget and the 
peacekeeping support account. 

 The proposals for a permanent solution for the secondary data centre for United 
Nations Headquarters will be presented prior to the biennium 2012-2013, duly 
addressing requests by the General Assembly in its resolution 63/262 with regard to 
reducing the size of secondary data centres and re-engineering departmental 
applications with a view to the predominant use of enterprise data centres.

 I. Introduction 
 
 

1. In his report on information and communications technology security, disaster 
recovery and business continuity for the United Nations, the Secretary-General 
outlined the urgent requirement to increase the size of the United Nations 
Headquarters secondary data centre and mitigate the potential risks under the capital 
master plan transition (A/62/477, para. 97). The United Nations Federal Credit 
Union (UNFCU) Building in Long Island City was initially identified as an 
attractive option for a secondary data centre as it would allow for: the consolidation 
of data centres; access to a lower-rent area along with the freeing up of existing 
office spaces for United Nations business needs; cooperative arrangements with 
New York-based funds and programmes; and improvements to tier 1 disaster 
recovery and business continuity capability and scalability. 

2. The General Assembly did not consider the above report during its sixty-
second session. Given the pressing need to proceed with setting up the secondary 
data centre in the new location, the Secretary-General, in a note dated 5 June 2008 
(A/C.5/62/29, annex), requested the Assembly to take note of the need for the 
Secretariat to enter into commitments not exceeding $13.2 million to meet the 
associated costs relating to establishment of the alternate Long Island City data 
centre, in order to continue to make progress on the capital master plan.  

3. With the provisioning of temporary funding mentioned above, a detailed 
analysis of the UNFCU Building for the Long Island City data centre was 
undertaken with the assistance of the contractors for the capital master plan. The 
analysis revealed, however, that the cost would be much higher than originally 
estimated, due to the need for structural reinforcements, fire protection and major 
upgrades to the electrical infrastructure. On 25 September 2008, the Secretariat 
decided that it was not in the best interest of the Organization to pursue the option 
of locating a secondary data centre in the UNFCU Building in Long Island City.  

4. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in its 
report of 16 October 2008 (A/63/487 and Corr.1 and 2), noted that the Long Island 
City site was no longer being pursued and stated that the General Assembly was no 
longer required to take any action on the resources requested. The Committee 
recommended that the Assembly request the Secretary-General to submit a new 
proposal for a secondary data centre for the United Nations Headquarters in New 
York, including detailed justification on the costs already incurred in connection 
with the Long Island City site (ibid., para. 83). 

5. The General Assembly, in its resolution 63/262 of 24 December 2008, decided 
not to approve the proposal of the Secretary-General for a new secondary data 
centre at that stage and requested him to report at the first part of its resumed sixty-
third session on the risk mitigation measures to be taken during the relocation of the 
primary data centre to the North Lawn. The Assembly also requested the Secretary-
General to consolidate systems in central data centres in order to strengthen disaster 
recovery and business continuity, to minimize the size of local primary and 
secondary data centres and to ensure that the Secretariat would use enterprise data 
centres rather than local data centres as far as possible.

 II. The problem 
 
 

6. The current secondary data centre at United Nations Headquarters is located in 
the DC2 Building, which has limited capacity for both cooling and electrical power. 
Furthermore, there is no emergency power generator support at that location in the 
event of a power failure on the public utility grid. When the cooling problem was 
first identified during the biennium 2000-2001, additional cooling was installed. 
However, with the continuing increase in demand for information and 
communications technology (ICT) services, additional electrical and heat loads 
generated in the data centre presented a high risk of failure, particularly during the 
summer months. The electrical infrastructure of the DC2 Building is near its 
maximum capacity, limiting the available alternatives for dealing with the problem. 
In the summer of 2008, the Information Technology Services Division was forced to 
shut down several backup systems in the DC2 data centre in order to mitigate 
problems associated with overheating. The stand-by servers for many systems such 
as the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), the official document 
system (ODS) and the Operations Processing Integrated Control System (OPICS) 
(Treasury system) are inactive for that reason. The data for these systems is, 
however, being backed up to the data centre in the DC2 Building for disaster 
recovery purposes.  

7. According to the current schedule for the capital master plan, the new North 
Lawn data centre site will be ready for occupation in November 2009. Due to the 
complexity and volume of applications currently being hosted in the primary data 
centre, it has been determined that relocating the data centre from the Secretariat 
Building to the North Lawn in one phase would be a high-risk option, given the risk 
it presents for disruption in the day-to-day operations of the Secretariat. 
Furthermore, this approach would also require a large financial outlay to cover the 
necessary ICT equipment and services. 

8. To mitigate the risk and expenditure involved, the relocation plan envisages a 
phased approach, spanning four months, from November 2009 to February 2010. In 
the first phase, expected to be about six weeks, the North Lawn data centre will be 
equipped with core infrastructure equipment (network and ICT security) and with 
approximately 25 per cent of the server and storage capacity, to be funded from the 
$7,145,500 approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 63/262 (see sect. IV, 
paras. 21 and 22). These resources comprise of $5,716,400 to be funded from the 
regular budget to be met from resources appropriated under the programme budget 
for the biennium 2008-2009 and $1,429,100 from the support account. Within this 
capacity, approximately 25 per cent of the systems hosted in the current primary 
data centre will be relocated to the North Lawn data centre. When this relocation is 
successfully completed, the primary data centre equipment released through this 
initial relocation will be dismantled, moved and installed in the North Lawn data 
centre to facilitate the next phase of relocation of systems. This process will 
continue iteratively until all the systems have been relocated from the existing 
primary data centre to the North Lawn data centre. 

9. During the relocation of systems from the primary data centre to the North 
Lawn data centre, as described in paragraph 8 above, in order to ensure 
uninterrupted service the secondary data centre will acquire the role of a primary 
data centre for the systems that are being relocated. However, because of its 
inadequate infrastructure facilities, especially the lack of emergency backup power, 



 A/63/743
 

5 09-25191 
 

the data centre in the DC2 Building poses a high risk to the continued provision of 
critical ICT services during the relocation of the primary data centre. If major 
systems, such as IMIS, e-mail, ODS or official United Nations websites, are 
disrupted, the Secretariat’s operations could be seriously affected. 

10. The current schedule for the capital master plan envisages that demolition 
work will be undertaken in the Secretariat Building from November 2009 onwards. 
While the contractors for the plan will take great care to avoid any damage or 
disruption to the infrastructure supporting the primary data centre in the Secretariat 
Building, the risks of major disruption to ICT services cannot be ruled out. Thus, a 
reliable secondary data centre is critical in order to mitigate the effects of any 
possible disruptions. 

11. It should also be noted that if the existing primary data centre in the Secretariat 
Building is not vacated, as planned, by the end of March 2010, the implementation 
of the capital master plan project will be delayed resulting in a cost increase 
currently estimated at about $14,000,000 per month due to several costs associated 
with swing space leases and the resumption of construction activity after an 
interruption. 

12. For the reasons outlined in the paragraphs above, it is necessary to ensure that 
a reliable and adequately equipped secondary data centre is fully operational by the 
end of October 2009. As explained in paragraph 6 above, the current secondary data 
centre in the DC2 Building cannot meet this requirement, nor can it be upgraded to 
meet this requirement. 
 
 

 III. Proposed solutions 
 
 

13. If the secondary data centre is to provide a reliable backup to the primary data 
centre it must be located away from the primary data centre, preferably in an area 
that uses power and communications links from a different utility grid. It cannot, 
however, be too far away since the costs of data transmission tend to increase with 
distance. In addition, the secondary data centre has to be within a 60-mile radius of 
the primary data centre at Headquarters. This physical distance limitation is imposed 
by the technology that is used for the replication of data from the primary data 
centre to the secondary data centre. The distance provides a safe margin within 
which it is possible to ensure that the data replicated to the secondary location can 
be recovered in full if the primary location is affected. Such technology is currently 
used for IMIS, security video and other mission-critical data.  

14. In September 2008, when it was determined that the UNFCU Building in Long 
Island City was not suitable for the secondary data centre, the Secretariat undertook 
a search for alternate sites in which to build a data centre. Three sites, located in 
Wappingers Falls, New York, Brooklyn, New York, and Jersey City, New Jersey, 
were initially identified as potential sites. The Brooklyn and Jersey City sites were 
eventually discounted owing to concerns surrounding security, the costs involved 
and the amount of construction that would be required. The Wappingers Falls site 
appeared to be the most promising from the point of view of cost and availability. A 
preliminary feasibility study, undertaken in December 2008, confirmed that this site 
could represent a good long-term solution in terms of distance from the Secretariat, 
the space available and the quality of the utilities (power, cooling and 
telecommunications).  



A/63/743  
 

09-25191 6 
 

15. A more detailed follow-up study, also initiated in December 2008, could not be 
completed until in January 2009. On the basis of that study, it was estimated that the 
costs associated with the “fit-out” of the Wappingers Falls data centre facility, not 
including the cost of the necessary ICT equipment, would be approximately 
$24.4 million. More importantly, it became clear that the Wappingers Falls site 
would not be ready in time for the Secretariat’s purpose, due to the lead-time for 
modifications to the facilities and the timing of consideration and approval of the 
current proposal by the General Assembly. 

16. Independent of this development regarding the inability to build a data centre 
facility in time for the relocation of the primary data centre, the Secretariat also had 
to re-evaluate its strategy relating to the secondary data centre for Headquarters, in 
the light of the adoption of resolution 63/262 by the General Assembly. In section 
IV of that resolution, the Assembly established several important principles for 
managing disaster recovery and business continuity, notably the Assembly: 

 (a) Requested the consolidation of systems in central data centres and the 
minimization of the size of local primary and secondary data centres; 

 (b) Encouraged a unified approach to disaster recovery and business 
continuity, utilizing all available infrastructure to achieve economies of scale and 
cost efficiencies; 

 (c) Requested that the Secretary-General ensure the use of enterprise data 
centres rather than local data centres as far as possible; 

 (d) Encouraged application and data re-engineering where it supported the 
long-term goal of managing data recovery and business continuity in system-wide 
enterprise data centres and where, from a long-term perspective, it is more cost-
effective than hosting them at a local data centre. 

17. Cumulatively, the above principles established by the General Assembly in 
December 2008 pointed to a case for a smaller secondary data centre in 
Headquarters than originally planned, with the flexibility to reduce its size, over 
time, by re-engineering and migrating applications to enterprise data centres. 

18. Since constructing a data centre was ruled out owing to the time constraint, 
and the case for a smaller data centre, with flexibility to shrink further, was 
strengthened by General Assembly resolution 63/262, the Secretariat undertook a 
market survey for commercial, “infrastructure-ready” data centre facilities, where it 
could immediately install and operate its own ICT equipment. These facilities 
already have raised floor, power and cooling. They can be made operational for the 
Secretariat’s purposes by installing ICT equipment and telecommunication links 
between the facility and the Headquarters campus.  

19. These data centre facilities are also available for a short period of time and 
afford the flexibility to scale their capacity up or down depending on the 
Secretariat’s requirements. In this regard, the availability and the scalability of these 
commercial data centre facilities make them potentially feasible solutions for both 
the short-term and the long-term requirements. 
 

  Timeline for implementation 
 

20. As mentioned earlier, the primary data centre has to be relocated from the 
Secretariat Building to the new North Lawn data centre in phases commencing from 



 A/63/743
 

7 09-25191 
 

1 November 2009. This includes about six weeks for setting up the initial ICT 
infrastructure in the North Lawn data centre. The relocation of systems will, 
therefore, effectively take place from mid-December 2009 to the end of February 
2010. 

21. The new secondary data centre needs, therefore, to be fully operational, 
including all systems that have to be relocated from the data centre in the DC2 
Building, by the end of October 2009. Setting up the initial ICT infrastructure for 
this data centre is also estimated to take about six weeks. The relocation of systems 
from the DC2 data centre to the new secondary data centre is estimated to take 
about 10 weeks. The new secondary data centre facility must, therefore, be available 
for occupation by 1 July 2009. 

22. For the above reasons, a commercial data centre facility must be identified and 
leased by 1 July 2009. This presents a very challenging timetable for all the 
associated procurement and negotiation processes to be completed, significantly 
increasing the risk that the deadline for the commissioning of the new secondary 
data centre cannot be met.  

23. The timely procurement of ICT equipment is not anticipated to present 
difficulties due to the availability of systems contracts and reasonable lead times for 
delivery of equipment. However, the establishment of the necessary commercial 
telecommunication links to the new secondary data centre will also require some 
lead time and may pose a challenge if the site is not identified quickly. 

24. Noting the tight time schedule and the associated costs attached to any delays, 
the Secretariat plans to enter into a service delivery agreement with the International 
Computing Centre, under financial rule 105.16(a)(iii) on cooperation with other 
organizations of the United Nations system. 

25. A number of risk mitigation strategies will be developed to ensure the 
organization achieves a best-value-for-money outcome from the International 
Computing Centre. First, the service delivery agreement process will be managed by 
the Procurement Division. Secondly, the Office of Information and Communications 
Technology will develop a robust statement of work, with clear deliverables, which 
the Procurement Division will use to benchmark estimates provided by the 
International Computing Centre. 

26. Due to the significant costs of any delay in the relocation of the primary data 
centre, to the overall cost by the capital master plan, the Secretariat proposes to 
maintain the current secondary data centre in the DC2 Building in working 
condition throughout the entire relocation. This plan supersedes the earlier plan to 
vacate the data centre in the DC2 Building as early as possible and it will provide an 
additional level of risk mitigation in the event there are any delays in the schedule 
of the capital master plan or in setting up the new secondary data centre. It will also 
provide some flexibility in dealing with certain systems that prove difficult to 
relocate to the new secondary data centre. The Secretariat, therefore, plans to 
decommission the data centre in the DC2 Building only by the end of June 2010, 
allowing some time for relocating non-critical systems that could not be relocated 
within the time frame outlined in paragraph 20 above. 

27. The above schedules for the various phases associated with the acquisition and 
commissioning of a new secondary data centre are graphically presented in figure I.

 IV. Recommended solution and related resource requirements 
 
 

28. The Secretariat proposes to lease a commercial “infrastructure-ready” data 
centre facility, with less capacity than originally envisaged, for the period from 
1 July 2009 to 31 December 2011, with an option to extend the lease, if necessary. 
Such a lease, including space, power, cooling and racks, is estimated to cost 
$4,288,000 per year, in addition to an initial set-up charge of $350,000. For the 
period from 1 July 2009 to 31 December 2011, the lease would cost $11,070,000. As 
indicated earlier, such a lease is expected to provide the flexibility to increase or 
decrease capacity, with reasonable notice. 

29. On the basis of the quantity and type of equipment to be installed and 
commissioned, it is estimated that a one-time cost for planning and installing all the 
equipment, including the operating systems software, would be $994,700. Once the 
operating systems software has been installed, all the applications in the data centre 
in the DC2 Building, both enterprise and departmental, have to be installed, 
configured, tested and tuned for performance in the new data centre. The effort 
involved in this is far more difficult to estimate than the commissioning of the new 
equipment, as it is dependent on the complexity of the applications. On the basis of 
an inventory of these applications and the classification of complexity into low, 
medium and high, the one-time cost for migrating the applications is estimated to be 
$1,000,000. 

30. Currently, the Secretariat utilizes the International Computing Centre for many 
of the data centre operations in the primary and secondary data centres at United 
Nations Headquarters in New York and in the United Nations Logistics Base at 
Brindisi, Italy. Consistent with General Assembly resolution 63/262 (sect. I, 
para. 6), in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to continue to 
utilize the services of the Centre in supporting the ICT activities of the United 
Nations, the Secretariat proposes to enter into a service delivery agreement with the 
Centre to manage the new secondary data centre from 1 July 2009.  

31. Under the above-mentioned service delivering agreement, the International 
Computing Centre will provide the necessary equipment and services for running 
the new secondary data centre for an estimated annual amount of $5,445,800. This 
amount will be offset by a reduction of $627,800 annually in the current service 
delivery agreement for the data centre in the DC2 Building from July 2010 when the 
data centre is decommissioned. The estimated cost of the new agreement would be 
$12,672,800 for the period from 1 July 2009 to 31 December 2011.

32. The total estimated cost of the new secondary data centre for the period 
from July 2009 to December 2011 would be $25,737,500, broken down as shown in 
table 1.

33. A proposal for a permanent solution for the secondary data centre for United 
Nations Headquarters will be submitted during the biennium 2012-2013, duly 
addressing a number of requests in General Assembly resolution 63/262 related to 
reducing the size of secondary data centres, re-engineering departmental 
applications with a view to using enterprise data centres and improving business 
continuity. The cost-benefit of retaining the leased commercial data centre as a 
permanent solution for United Nations Headquarters will also be addressed in that 
context.  
 
 

 V. Summary of resource requirements 
 
 

34. About 20 per cent of the capacity in the existing primary data centre in the 
Secretariat building is utilized by peacekeeping operations. Accordingly, 20 per cent 
of the costs are met from the peacekeeping support account, while the remaining 
80 per cent are financed from the regular budget. 

35. The same cost-sharing arrangement is proposed for the new secondary data 
centre on the basis of the proportion of capacity used for peacekeeping and 
non-peacekeeping operations. The cost-sharing ratio will be reviewed again for the 
2012-2013 biennium if the proportion of capacity used by peacekeeping operations 
changes due to the migration of systems to enterprise data centres.  

36. Table 2 summarizes the resource requirements for the secondary data centre 
for the period from July 2009 to December 2011, based on the recommendation in 
paragraphs 34 and 35 above.

37. The recurring costs for the lease of the facilities, including space, power and 
cooling, is estimated to be $11,070,000 for the period from July 2009 to December 
2011. A sum of $1,995,000 will be required under contractual services to cover the 
non-recurring costs for setting up ICT equipment and systems in the new secondary 
data centre. The recurring cost for the provision of ICT equipment and services, 
including maintenance, is estimated at $12,673,000 for the period from July 2009 to 
December 2011.  
 
 

 VI. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 
 
 

38. The General Assembly is requested:
