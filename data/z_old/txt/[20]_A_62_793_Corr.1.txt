  Paragraph 42 
 

The paragraph should read 

  Client services 
 

42. While providing core technological capabilities to the Organization remains 
the foundation of all ICT activities, the effective delivery of services requires close 
alignment with all departments, offices and missions. To achieve this, the Office of 
Information and Communications Technology includes three units — Headquarters 
services (New York-based), field services and global services — which are 
dedicated to maintaining this close association between the Office and other 
organizational units. Each unit is led by a senior client services manager who reports 
directly to the Chief Information Technology Officer. These client services units are 
accountable and responsible to their respective organizational units for the full range 
of ICT programmes and services available. The professionals who serve in this 
capacity must build strong relationships with their clients to ensure the strategic 
alignment of ICT to substantive work programmes and to ensure continuous 
customer satisfaction for all of the departments within their purview.
