 Summary 
 The present report addresses the request of the General Assembly contained in 
resolution 60/283 concerning the proposals submitted by the Secretary-General in his 
report on investing in information and communications technology (A/60/846/ 
Add.1). It will be noted that the present report updates and revises the previous 
document (A/62/510), which, while it had been reviewed by the Advisory Committee 
on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, has not yet been considered by the Fifth 
Committee. 

 The report presents proposals and plans for the phased implementation and 
deployment in all offices of the United Nations Secretariat, including offices away 
from Headquarters, regional commissions, peacekeeping and political missions, and 
other field missions, of a new generation of systems to replace the Integrated 
Management Information System and other ancillary systems. The core of the new 
system will be based on a commercially available enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
software. 

 The absence of an integrated information system for managing resources is 
seriously hampering the ability of the United Nations to deliver results effectively 
and efficiently. The goal of implementing an ERP system is to build an integrated 
global information system that fully supports the needs of the United Nations and 
enables the effective management of human, financial and physical resources, and 
that is based on streamlined processes and best practices. The report also proposes 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 2 
 

enterprise-wide systems for managing day-to-day services, through a customer 
relationship management system (CRM), and managing knowledge of the 
Organization, by way of an enterprise content management (ECM) system. 

 A decision by the General Assembly is requested on the proposals and 
financing of the ERP, ECM and CRM projects.

 I. Introduction 
 
 

1. In his report of 6 March 2006 entitled “Investing in the United Nations: for a 
stronger Organization worldwide”, the Secretary-General proposed “to replace the 
Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), Galaxy and other stand-alone 
information and communications technology (ICT) management support systems 
with a fully integrated global system supporting the full range of management 
functions” (A/60/692 and Corr.1, proposal 10). 

2. In a subsequent report (A/60/846/Add.1), the Secretary-General provided 
preliminary findings and a high-level road map for maximizing the value of ICT to 
the United Nations Secretariat worldwide. As part of his in-depth fact-finding study, 
the Secretary-General explained the need, anticipated benefits and unique 
opportunities for replacing IMIS and other ancillary information systems. The 
Secretary-General further anticipated that he would complete the study and provide 
detailed costings and a timetable for consideration by the General Assembly at its 
sixty-first session. Unforeseen delays in the recruitment of the Chief Information 
Technology Officer and the need to have the proposal reviewed by that officer, 
however, have led to the delay in the formulation of the full proposal for 
consideration by the General Assembly. 

3. In paragraph 4 of section II of its resolution 60/283, the General Assembly 
decided “to replace the Integrated Management Information System with a next-
generation enterprise resource planning system or other comparable system”. The 
Assembly further requested the Secretary-General to submit at its resumed sixty-
first session the comprehensive report, which should include, inter alia, 
(a) information on previous reform proposals, their impact on the existing proposals 
and references to previous relevant resolutions and decisions of the Assembly; 
(b) costs and administrative implications; (c) assessment of previous investments in 
ICT, lessons learned and expected time frames for the introduction of the system 
and arrangements for continuation of the current system during the transitional 
period.  

4. The present report addresses the above request and proposes an approach for 
the implementation of enterprise systems and a number of measures for approval by 
the General Assembly. At the same time, it is recalled that the Secretary-General, in 
his report on information and communications technology security, disaster 
recovery and business continuity for the United Nations (A/62/477), presented 
proposals for a global operational framework for information and communications 
technology infrastructure and provided an analysis of infrastructure improvements 
linked to the implementation of enterprise resource planning. Accordingly, that 
report should be considered as an integral part of and has a direct link to the 
proposals for implementation of enterprise systems contained herein.

 II. Information and communications technology in the 
United Nations Secretariat 
 
 

 A. Yesterday’s solutions: Integrated Management 
Information System  
 
 

5. The development of IMIS was a milestone as it marked the emergence of 
information technology as a discipline touching all areas of administration and 
management in the Organization. IMIS was developed as a functionally integrated 
system to support key processes such as human resources management, payroll, 
finance and accounting, requisitioning and funds control, budget execution and 
travel management. IMIS was introduced in conjunction with desktop, networked 
computing and office automation tools, such as electronic mail, to all offices where 
IMIS was being used. 

6. In 2002, the Secretary-General submitted his ICT strategy for the Secretariat 
(see A/57/620). The 2002 ICT strategy focused on strengthening the global ICT 
infrastructure so that it could take full advantage of advances in telecommunications 
and Internet technologies. The strategy was successful in establishing worldwide 
standards and adding significant coherence in the manner ICT investments were 
being managed and aligned. The strategy also stated a clear direction in relation to 
IMIS, which was to remain as the core administrative system for a period between 
five and seven years.  

7. The launching of IMIS and the 2002 strategy were subsequently affected and 
conditioned by major developments in the technology market, and an accelerated 
shift of focus in the United Nations to field activities. In short, IMIS was designed 
and developed at a time when the context began to change rapidly and profoundly. 
As a consequence, a few years after its implementation, the following became 
evident: 

 (a) IMIS could not take full advantage of significant advances in global 
communications; 

 (b) Although functionally integrated, IMIS was deployed and operated 
locally at each duty station. Integrating information for online reporting and global 
management purposes became difficult; 

 (c) Although partially implemented in peacekeeping operations, IMIS was 
not adapted to support the specific needs of the peacekeeping environment, such as 
supply chain and logistics management. 

8. The functional gaps of IMIS were addressed by relatively modest investments 
in tactical systems, some of which were integrated into IMIS through interfaces 
while others remained as stand-alone systems. 

9. The implementation of IMIS and the 2002 ICT strategy rendered significant 
benefits. However, the Organization today faces challenges that demand profound 
transformation beyond the capabilities of IMIS and its ancillary legacy systems 
currently being used. 
 
 



A/62/510/Rev.1

 B. Today’s situation: an imperative for change 
 
 

10. After 14 years since the live date of release 1 at Headquarters, IMIS has 
reached the end of its useful life. Cost of maintenance and ongoing support no 
longer match the benefits that staff and managers expect from the information 
system upon which their day-to-day operations and decisions depend. Moreover, the 
commitment to adopt the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), 
pursuant to paragraph 1 of section IV of General Assembly resolution 60/283, will 
require the Organization to introduce significant changes to accounting processes in 
order to achieve compliance.  

11. The Organization also needs to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of 
the services it provides to a vast array of “customers”. The systems which are 
currently in place to support customer-service areas are obsolete, not integrated, 
duplicative, and inefficient. 

12. The lack of integrated and complete data on resources, both at Headquarters 
and in the field, is a serious impediment to effective management, planning and 
decision-making. This deficiency is becoming increasingly acute as the complexity 
of the Organization’s activities continues to grow.  

13. Furthermore, as a knowledge-intensive organization, the Secretariat spends 
significant resources in the production, management and distribution of rapidly 
increasing amounts of documents and other information residing in a variety of 
media. The processes and systems currently utilized in managing this knowledge 
capital are ineffective, inefficient and vulnerable.  

14. However, perhaps the most compelling imperative for a new ICT system is the 
changing nature of the Organization itself. The Secretariat is very different today 
than it was just a decade ago. United Nations Headquarters in New York is one of 
many duty stations around the world, rather than the centre of gravity it once was. 
Peacekeeping operations have proliferated at an unprecedented pace and have grown 
in both size and complexity, often in regions with poor basic infrastructure. To 
ensure a minimum of reliable automation and telecommunication capacity, a series 
of new information systems have had to be developed rapidly, but it has proven 
difficult to integrate these systems, as well as other ancillary information systems 
operating in different duty stations, with IMIS — the United Nations system of 
record. This has led to a patchwork of fragmented, support-intensive, home-grown 
systems that are not sustainable and efficient for the long term. 

15. In recognition of the increasingly global arena of work and the many new 
challenges of the twenty-first century, Member States have approved several reform 
initiatives to better equip the Organization in meeting these challenges. In 
consonance with those reform initiatives, the Secretary-General is fully committed 
to fundamentally modernize the way the Organization carries out its day-to-day 
work, by streamlining and simplifying processes. Information technology is a 
critical tool for achieving this Secretariat-wide transformation, by introducing 
global enterprise systems that are more efficient, nimble and rational. 

16. Recognizing the strategic importance of ICT, the General Assembly approved 
the establishment of the position of Chief Information Technology Officer at the 
level of Assistant Secretary-General in the Executive Office of the Secretary-
General (see resolution 60/283, sect. II, para. 1). The Chief Information Technology 



 A/62/510/Rev.1
 

7 08-30226 
 

Officer was appointed and assumed his duties in late August 2007. The Chief 
Information Technology Officer has now developed a comprehensive report on ICT 
investments to maximize its value to the Secretariat worldwide (see report of the 
Secretary-General entitled “Investing in information and communications 
technology: information and communications strategy for the United Nations 
Secretariat” (A/62/793)). The strategy serves as the Organization-wide agreement on 
the future direction of ICT. The aforementioned report builds upon the significant 
progress made since the launch of the ICT strategy in 2002, and it seeks to extend 
that achievement in order to meet the strategic ICT needs of the Secretariat over the 
next three to five years. The projects proposed in the present report not only serve as 
the main building block for achieving the new ICT vision of “a stronger ICT for a 
better United Nations” but also directly support the goals of the strategic 
programmes to be undertaken under the ICT strategy. 

17. In addition to establishing a global management framework for ICT, a new 
generation of business systems is being introduced that will form key pillars in 
implementing management reform and modernizing the Organization. These include 
an enterprise resource planning system (ERP), for managing the financial, human 
and physical resources; a customer relationship management (CRM) system, for 
better handling the vast array of day-to-day services; and the enterprise content 
management system (ECM), for managing the exploding amount of documents and 
other information in a variety of media, such as website, e-mail, picture and video.  
 
 

 III. Managing resources: enterprise resource planning system 
 
 

 A. Goals and objectives of developing an enterprise resource 
planning system 
 
 

18. The replacement of IMIS presents an opportunity to fully and globally 
integrate all resource management functions across the Organization through the 
implementation of an ERP system. An ERP system provides an integrated suite of 
information technology applications that support activities such as finance and 
budget management, human resources management, supply chain management, 
central support services, and other corporate core functions. Most importantly, the 
main value of an ERP system is the opportunity to streamline and improve the 
operations of an entire organization through process re-engineering, sharing of 
common data, and implementation of best practices and standards. 

19. The main objectives of the ERP project can be summarized as follows: 

 (a) To have a global system that captures accurate and timely core resource 
data from the global Secretariat at all duty stations, including peace operations and 
other field missions; 

 (b) To support decision-making by linking programmes and operations with 
the resources allocated and showing what has been utilized; 

 (c) To reduce the average time required for administrative processes, by 
streamlining and integrating business processes, make them simpler and use greater 
automation, reflecting best practices; 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 8 
 

 (d) To increase organizational efficiency by reducing the amount of staff 
time spent on manual processes, and redirecting resources to high priority and 
value-added work; 

 (e) To support the implementation of IPSAS by the Secretariat;  

 (f) To enable easy access to reports by Member States, United Nations staff 
and the public, as appropriate; 

 (g) To support management reform by enhancing accountability, 
transparency, and internal controls for all transactions relating to resources. 

20. The main functionalities sought from the new ERP system are expected to 
encompass functions such as programme planning, budgeting, contributions and 
performance; human resources management and administration; payroll, including 
management of benefits and contribution to pension, medical and insurance 
schemes; supply chain management, including procurement; assets and facilities 
management; general accounting, travel and other administrative flows; reporting to 
management and stakeholders, and more.  

21. The new ERP system will need to have the capability to support functions 
specific to peacekeeping operations in the area of logistics, transportation, fuel and 
rations systems and other requirements which are not common in other 
organizations of the United Nations system. 

22. The ERP project will be guided by the following principles: 

 (a) The ERP software selected must be capable of providing satisfactory 
performance, even under the demanding conditions in peacekeeping environments; 

 (b) The aim should be to operate a single central system (“single-instance 
data”) to ensure global transactions and reporting capabilities and alignment of 
information across different offices; 

 (c) Customization of the ERP software should be kept to a minimum, to 
avoid unnecessary costs. Instead of customizing, existing administrative processes 
should be changed in line with the chosen software; 

 (d) Common business practices should be used to increase uniformity and 
compatibility within the global Secretariat; 

 (e) Self-service options should be emphasized to a greater extent, making it 
possible for staff to access, verify and update resource data; 

 (f) The ERP system should be designed and implemented in a manner to 
ensure accuracy, integrity, consistency and timeliness of data, and avoid duplicative 
data entry; 

 (g) The system should be developed in a way to ensure that the needs of 
offices away from Headquarters, peace operations and other missions are fully taken 
into account; 

 (h) Regular and open communication with Member States, managers and 
staff should be maintained throughout the project period.

 B. Expected benefits of an enterprise resource planning system 
 
 

23. The new ERP system will be at the core of the Organization’s reform of 
financial, administrative and management operations. The system will be a catalyst 
for fundamental transformation of the way business is conducted globally by the 
Secretariat. It also has the potential to improve the efficiency and, most 
significantly, the overall effectiveness of the Organization.  

24. Typical key benefits of an ERP system include effective and efficient business 
processes; access to accurate, timely, and authoritative data; informed decision-
making; faster responses to issues and problems; consolidation and elimination of 
current systems; compliance with best practices and standards; opportunity for 
resource redeployment and skills development; improved transparency and 
accountability. 

25. Following are some examples of specific improvements the new ERP system is 
expected to bring to the Organization: 

 (a) Increased operational effectiveness and timeliness: 

(i) With integrated resource mobilization functionality, the Organization 
could achieve a concentrated and expedited approach to identifying, securing 
and utilizing donor funding; 

(ii) An improved ability to align budgets closely with acquisition plans, and 
purchasing and delivery of goods and services would allow managers to better 
monitor programme execution. Unplanned activities could be highlighted and 
dealt with proactively; 

(iii) A tighter link between supply chain planning and logistics with finance 
could lead to timely substantiation of liabilities related to contingent-owned 
equipment reimbursements. In addition, portals with Member States noting the 
verified accrued expenditures would strengthen transparency; 

(iv) In the area of travel, continuous monitoring of incurred travel and other 
offsite conference costs coupled with sound financial modelling could lead to 
improved financial planning and optimal meeting site selection; 

(v) With a global database and access to personnel data including 
performance, work history and developed competencies, managers throughout 
the Organization would be better equipped to take optimal decisions on staff 
transfers and special project assignments. In particular, an ERP system could 
allow timely deployment of qualified personnel in critical areas in 
peacekeeping and field missions; 

 (b) Improved accountability: 

(i) Substantive project management, an area significantly lacking in IMIS, 
would allow programme managers to plan, allocate and monitor resources 
based on defined activities, tasks and timetables. Project portfolio management 
functionality would enable the monitoring of project activities by exception; 

(ii) Improved planning, linkage with real-time cost parameters and 
enterprise-wide assessment of inventory levels could lead to greater 
utilization; 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 10 
 

(iii) The ERP system is expected to provide better internal controls across the 
broad range of financial, procurement and staffing processes and improve 
accountability; 

 (c) Adoption of international best practices and standards: 

(i) The implementation of ERP software will facilitate compliance with 
IPSAS; 

(ii) Commercial ERP often results in a high degree of professional 
development of staff and therefore enables greater mobility of human 
resources; 

(iii) Global integration would enable coordinated strategic personnel planning 
that could result in improved accuracy of projected vacancies and shortfalls in 
workforce and competencies; 

(iv) Integrated records in performance, competencies, and assignment 
requirements would enable proactivity in highlighting and implementing 
workforce development and training plans; 

(v) IPSAS compliance is supported by configured ERP systems. It is 
expected that the management of accounting cycles and the generation of 
consolidated financial statements would be considerably strengthened and 
standardized as a result of configuring the ERP system to be compliant with 
IPSAS process and data requirements; 

 (d) Enhanced treasury operations: 

(i) An integrated treasury system would allow the management and 
monitoring of cash flow projections with considerably higher precision. That 
in turn could lead to a reduced float and a better ratio of investment to cash 
holdings; 

(ii) Cashier activities could be strengthened by the introduction of global 
currency bank accounts. In principle, utilizing centralized currency accounts 
from any location could strengthen the controls and improve transaction 
timings; 

 (e) Enhanced transparency: 

 An ERP could promote consistency and transparency in the application 
of rules and operating procedures in all administrative disciplines throughout 
the Organization; 

(f) Higher client satisfaction: 

 ERP software provides self-service applications, which will make it 
possible for eligible persons to request benefits online. This will reduce 
frustration among staff currently relying on time-consuming paper-based 
requests. ERP will enable staff to verify their annual leave balances online, 
update contact information and conduct vital personnel transactions; 

 (g) Process improvements: 

(i) ERP implementations in the United Nations Development Programme, 
the United Nations Children’s Fund and the World Food Programme have 
demonstrated efficiency benefits, such as the elimination of reconciliation 



 A/62/510/Rev.1
 

11 08-30226 
 

tasks, reduced paperwork and enhanced staff productivity. Specific efficiency 
benefits gained by those organizations include the avoidance of duplicate data 
entry, reduced human error, and increased supply chain visibility through 
immediate access to all relevant information. Those organizations also 
benefited from analytics embedded in the ERP software by enabling their staff 
to be responsive and take timely action, thus avoiding costly delays; 

(ii) The benefit for those organizations was redirected to enhancing 
effectiveness in managing resources. Similar benefits for the Secretariat, based 
on 10,000 administrative staff members redirecting around 15 per cent of 
current process steps, should yield five to six hours per year for each United 
Nations staff member. 

 

  Productivity gains and cost avoidance 
 

26. An ERP system enables operating an acquisition process that integrates 
budget, procurement and supply chain from a central platform with the full visibility 
and proactive control of the organizational requirements. With the proper ERP 
modules, it therefore should be possible to leverage buying power for consolidated 
purchasing of the most commonly required goods and services, for which the 
Organization can expect volume discounts. Improved capability to manage the 
requirements, paired with a global visibility of existing contracts, should help to 
reduce unplanned spending and improve efficiencies in acquisition costs and process 
timeline while strengthening internal control. Certain private commercial entities 
have been able to achieve procurement operating cost reductions of up to 10 per 
cent once a full suite of ERP modules has been implemented. 
 

  Centralized management of information technology systems 
 

27. During the transition from IMIS and other legacy systems, resources are 
required to run these systems in parallel until the ERP is completely implemented. 
After transition, a number of legacy systems are expected to be retired and resources 
redirected to support the new ERP operations. 
 
 

 C. Project governance and organization 
 
 

28. On a project of this magnitude, strong governance is essential: to steer the 
project, monitor progress against plans, resolve conflicts without delay, decide on 
work priorities, help to manage changes and communicate progress to all 
stakeholders. The primary purpose of the ERP system is to enable the Secretariat to 
effectively and efficiently carry out the work that Member States expect. The ERP 
project is a “business” project, and therefore needs to be led by senior management. 
The main policy decision-making body is the ERP Steering Committee, chaired by 
the Under-Secretary-General for Management and consisting of the Chief 
Information Technology Officer; the Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support; 
the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management, the Assistant 
Secretary-General, Controller, and for Central Support Services, Department of 
Management;1 and the Deputy Director-General of the United Nations Office at 
Vienna. The ERP Steering Committee reports to the Management Committee.

Information Technology Services Division and the Facilities and Commercial Services Division participate. 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 12 
 

29. The detailed planning and execution of the project will be by the ERP project 
team, reporting to the Chief Information Technology Officer, coordinated and led by 
a programme management office headed by a Project Director, who is ultimately 
accountable for the execution of the project in collaboration with the Assistant 
Secretaries-General responsible for the four main functional areas: human resources, 
finance and budget, supply chain, and central support services. The project team 
includes experts on change management, process management, administration 
management, and technology management, as well as four sub-teams, one for each 
of the functional areas. 

30. To ensure an institutional link with user departments in the course of planning 
and implementation, advisory groups will be established. This will serve as a 
mechanism for two-way communications and help to embed the ERP project as an 
organization-wide endeavour that will require engagement by managers and staff at 
large, but will ultimately yield benefits for the United Nations Secretariat 
worldwide.

 D. Progress to date 
 
 

32. The ERP project cannot be properly initiated until a dedicated fully staffed 
project team and funding are in place. Nevertheless, an ad hoc arrangement, drawing 
on the limited budgetary discretion approved by the General Assembly in section III 
of its resolution 60/283, has been used to put in place an interim small core team of 
16 staff. For the first half of 2008, such authority has been utilized to meet initial 
resource requirements in the amount of $3.4 million for a dedicated project team, 
the continuation of ongoing preparatory project activities and ensuring progress on 
major foundation tasks relating to the ERP system. That commitment would be 
reversed into the overall project costs sought in the present report, should the 
General Assembly approve the proposal, and would be reported in the context of the 
performance report or annual report, as appropriate. The team has achieved 
significant progress in some preparatory activities, including by engaging internal 
stakeholders widely in consultations on user needs and scope. The results enabled 
progressing acquisition activities for software. The experiences of other United 
Nations agencies that have already implemented ERP software were important 
references for the preparatory activities of the Secretariat. However, not all desirable 
preparations for accelerated project initiation could be completed under these 
interim arrangements. The following paragraphs summarize the progress so far. 
 

 1. User needs and scope 
 

33. The identification of user needs as functional requirements was a major 
activity spanning the second half of 2007. The extensive requirements-gathering, 
analysis and validation process involved representative staff from Headquarters, 
offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions and field missions. 
Important elements that were elaborated included the requirements for cost 
accounting, IPSAS, recruitment, procurement and associated management reporting. 
The compilation of detailed functional requirements for the ERP software was 
completed in December 2007. The scope of the requirements was comprehensive, 
ensuring the best possible capture of stakeholders’ needs. Work is ongoing to refine 
the scope in conjunction with stakeholder determination of the desired system 
architecture and high-level business process re-engineering. 
 

 2. Acquisition activities 
 

34. The acquisition of commercial ERP products and services is complex and 
requires significant lead times. Sustained efforts have focused on defining 
requirements for software and system integration services as well as on ensuring a 
transparent and competitive procurement process. 

35. The approach for procurement involves the acquisition activities for the 
software and integration services being partially overlapping and shortening the 
overall acquisition timeline. That approach has been planned in a manner ensuring 
the integrity of acquisition activities. The terms and descriptions used in drafting the 
Statement of Work were carefully scrutinized to ensure that they are generic in 
nature and not software-specific. System integration proposals cover a 
comprehensive range of services requiring significant time and effort to prepare. 
The capacity of the core team will be supplemented temporarily with some subject 
matter experts. The temporary supplementation will ensure that key personnel can 
participate in overlapping procurement activities for software and integration 



A/62/510/Rev.1

services. The capacity for concurrent participation is necessary to ensure 
consistency and the application of lessons learned. 
 

 3. Project management activities 
 

36. In order to address the multitude of complex concurrent project tasks in a 
timely and orchestrated manner, a full-time dedicated project team must be 
established as soon as possible. A project organization strategy has been established 
which will ensure a competitive selection of the members of the proposed ERP 
project team as soon as the recommended staffing has been approved. To that end, 
preliminary action has already been taken on post classifications and to have posts 
advertised progressively through the Galaxy system, with the clear proviso that such 
posts are fully subject to approval of funding by the General Assembly. Based on the 
current plan and subject to General Assembly approvals of the proposals, selection 
recommendations in accordance with established human resources procedures will 
be completed promptly, with the majority likely by the third quarter of 2008. 
 

 4. Other activities 
 

37.  An enterprise-wide system architecture that aligns business and technology is 
being developed by drawing together the documentation of strategic frameworks, 
programme planning, organizational diagrams, the accountability framework, data 
models and supporting technology. The system architecture describes the context of 
work programmes and operations, responsible organizations, system design, 
technology infrastructure and possible solutions. Efforts during the preparatory 
phase are focusing on the strategic, programme and organizational context, which 
facilitates the re-engineering of high-level business processes. 

38. The Secretariat is streamlining and harmonizing its organizational, managerial 
and administrative arrangements as a prerequisite for the ERP implementation. 
Towards this end, senior management is committed to specific improvements early 
in the project ensuring that the ERP system is successful in assisting the 
implementation of change. Work has commenced to review critically the current 
policies, procedures and associated arrangements with the goal of identifying key 
areas where changes are required. Key approaches for implementing international 
best practices are being identified so that work on high-level business process  
re-engineering can proceed expeditiously. The examination should result in 
agreement on a framework to guide the detailed ERP process design and 
configuration work to commence after ERP software selection. An associated 
activity is to establish key baseline indicators in all business areas. Overall progress 
against the baseline will be included in annual reports. 

39. In addition, a data migration planning exercise will be conducted in the 
summer of 2008 to ensure that all existing data sources, particularly those outside 
IMIS and ancillary systems, are analysed. The planning will include the detailed 
arrangements necessary for all data to be properly prepared in terms of 
completeness and accuracy for migration to the ERP system. Applying lessons 
learned from the development and implementation of IMIS, activity planning will 
include meeting the more stringent requirements imposed by the new ERP system 
on the quality of data. The proper cleaning, testing and conversion of data will be 
closely monitored and, for each case, will be a prerequisite for deciding to 
commence operations with the new system.

 E. Implementation plan 
 
 

40. Once the preparatory phase is completed, the implementation plan calls for 
implementation in two waves, as shown in the timetable below at figure II. Wave 1 
would commence in the third quarter of 2008 following the completion of 
preparatory activities. It will focus on key management priorities and is expected to 
take 30 months. Based on the current project progress, Wave 1 would be 
substantially completed by the end of 2010. Specific timings and technical 
arrangements for acceptance testing and data conversions will be determined by the 
integration services once they are engaged. Wave 2 will focus on the implementation 
of remaining functionalities of the ERP software solution and is expected to take 24 
months. The current implementation plan foresees the first quarter of 2011 as the 
earliest start date for Wave 2, with a target for substantial completion by the end of 
2012. Every effort will be made to complete the project within the projected time 
frames. Each wave will be succeeded by a short evaluation. Annual progress reports 
will be submitted to the General Assembly, including inter alia, details of overall 
progress against the baseline. 
 

  Figure II 
Timetable 
 

 
 

41. The functionalities assigned to each wave will be designed and built based on 
configuring the ERP software solution to meet the requirements of the Secretariat. 
Design and build activities will be supported by associated detailed business process 
re-engineering, legacy data preparation, data cleansing and change management. 
Those activities will be undertaken by subject matter experts from Headquarters, 
offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions and field missions and 
closely coordinated by the ERP project team. Configuration will include meeting 
IPSAS process and data requirements that will be guided by an approach for making 
IPSAS policies operational. Alignment with requirements will be limited strictly

within minimal levels of customization. On completion of design and build, ERP 
functionalities will be deployed globally to all relevant Secretariat locations. The 
deployment will be supported by data migration, software training and technology 
hosting activities undertaken in coordination with, and with the support of, user 
organizations and specialist areas. 
 

 1. Implementation of Wave 1  
 

42. The implementation of Wave 1 will entail establishing a dedicated project team 
with the capacity to arrange coordinated contributions by stakeholder subject matter 
experts and engage fully with system integration services. 

43. Priorities given to recruitment and mobility are currently being met in a 
separate project for a talent management system, which is expected to be 
implemented by the end of 2008. Linkages for resource transactions will be 
established between the talent management system and the ERP system. Other 
priorities for early implementation will be procurement and limited self-service 
capabilities involving staff records. Based on the current plan, the first of these fast-
tracked capabilities are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2009.  

44. Wave 1 also replaces IMIS, Sun and other ancillary legacy functionalities with 
IPSAS compliant core financials, which includes accounts payable, accounts 
receivable, general ledger, treasury, cash management and investment accounting. 
Additional functionalities include budget allocation and execution, which support 
monitoring the flow of monetary transactions and funds from allotments to 
disbursements. In order to support IPSAS further, Wave 1 will introduce limited 
financial functionalities for programme planning, cost accounting and trust funds 
including grants, as well as human resources functionality of attendance and leave 
administration. In the human resources management area, Wave 1 will cover the 
appointment and administration of staff whose salaries are not currently paid 
through IMIS, such as locally recruited staff in the field. Human resources 
functionalities for that category of staff members will include post and staffing table 
management, benefits and compensation management. Supply chain, procurement, 
logistics and central support functionalities for assets, facilities, inventories and 
related staff costs, as well as contracts management will also be included. Wave 1 
will have reporting and data warehousing elements that are associated with the 
introduced functionalities. Wherever feasible, existing systems will be temporarily 
interfaced with the new system, provided that they do not compromise IPSAS 
compliance.  
 

 2. Implementation of Wave 2 
 

45. Wave 2 will introduce and integrate strategic management functions such as 
budgeting, results-based management, risk management, resource mobilization, 
programme management and project management. Those functionalities will aim to 
strengthen financial planning and programme management. Wave 2 will also cover 
the remaining supply chain and central support functionalities, including global 
transportation management and travel management. Once the human resources 
functionalities are completed, the system would cover staff administration and 
payroll for those staff already currently administered through IMIS. The completion 
of data warehousing will enable the introduction of multilevel management 
reporting, executive dashboards and data interchange for Member States and donors. 



 A/62/510/Rev.1
 

17 08-30226 
 

 3. Technology infrastructure preparations  
 

46. Successful implementation of key ERP project milestones is dependent on the 
timely completion of the proposed preparatory work on the technology side. 
Achieving the management priorities of the ERP project relies on the synchronized 
implementation of technology infrastructure for disaster recovery and business 
continuity as proposed in the report of the Secretary-General (A/62/477). The 
technology infrastructure necessary to support hosting the fully operational ERP 
system will critically rely on the data centre site at the United Nations Logistics 
Base at Brindisi, Italy, and a secondary site in Valencia, Spain as proposed in the 
disaster recovery and business continuity project detailed in the aforementioned 
report. Accordingly, both the present report and the report on business continuity are 
considered integrally linked. 
 

 4. Transition from legacy systems 
 

47. The transition from IMIS and other legacy systems requires development of a 
large number of system interfaces and data repositories during ERP implementation 
until all functionalities are put into operation in the new system. The level of 
support for IMIS and other systems will be generally the same. However, it will 
require increased levels of effort from all technology areas during the transition 
period for building interfaces, data migration and reconciliation of multiple data 
sources. 

48. The transition will commence with the data migration for functionalities in 
Wave 1. Transition will continue for specific functionalities until after the 
completion of Wave 2. An example of the size and complexity of data migration is 
the human resources system of records, which is supported by IMIS in eight 
locations, a number of complementary legacy systems and paper files for each staff 
member. The separate IMIS and other legacy systems are not sufficiently integrated 
to provide highly reliable validation of key data. The majority of transactional data 
is currently taken from copies of original documents, such as certificates, passports, 
and the like, and is re-entered into IMIS and other systems on each occasion that it 
is required. Transition therefore involves comprehensive efforts in extracting paper-
based data and accurately entering such information into the ERP system, ensuring 
that all fields for key data are accurately populated.  

49. The human resources functionalities utilize a range of systems in addition to 
IMIS, including Galaxy and Nucleus, which have linkages with IMIS. Other 
systems used are the field personnel management system and Progen, which have 
limited integration with IMIS. However, these two systems have linkages with 
Nucleus in the former case and with the Sun in the latter case. As concerns most 
finance functionalities, in addition to a direct linkage with IMIS, there is also a 
separate direct linkage with the Sun system. The transition during Wave 2 involves 
additional systems currently linked with IMIS, such as the budget information 
system and the electronic personnel appraisal system as well as the need to 
transition from other separate systems such as Procure Plus, Mercury and Galileo 
for procurement and asset management.  
 
 



A/62/510/Rev.1

 F. Operation and resource requirements 
 
 

50. All enterprise systems, including the ERP system, will operate from two data 
centres situated in the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and at a 
proposed secondary site in Valencia, Spain. Those sites, which would be at the core 
of the disaster recovery and business continuity plan for the Secretariat, would host 
the two hubs for telecommunications and computer operations for all offices of the 
Secretariat. Requirements relating to the disaster recovery/business continuity plan 
contained in the report of the Secretary-General (A/62/477) and the related report of 
the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/62/7/ 
Add.31) are presently before the General Assembly. Accordingly, the requirements 
for hardware and infrastructure costs have not been repeated in the present report. 

51. However, it should be noted that the resources requested for the disaster 
recovery and business continuity plan will cover telecommunications, computer and 
data-storage equipment and human resources earmarked for the operation of the 
disaster recovery and business continuity facilities. Until the new ERP system is 
fully implemented, those facilities will provide business continuity capabilities for 
critical systems such as IMIS, currently operating in all offices and peacekeeping 
missions. Upon full implementation of the ERP system, the same facilities will serve 
as the operational platform for the new system. 

52. The full deployment of an ERP system in an organization of the size and 
complexity of the global United Nations Secretariat will require significant 
resources over the course of its implementation, which is expected to take 
approximately five years. Once implemented, recurring expenditures would relate to 
the upgrade, maintenance, and operation of the system. However, it is important to 
note that the adoption of a commercial solution in addition to the system’s 
centralized operation will substantially reduce recurrent costs provided that 
customization is kept to a minimum. It is expected that the useful life of the ERP 
system will be 15 to 20 years. 
 

  Total project costs estimates 
 

53. The project costs estimates cover the implementation and deployment of the 
ERP system.  

54. At this stage pending the conclusion of procurement activities, the cost of 
implementation and deployment of the ERP system does not benefit from details on 
firm contract costs for software and system integration services (see below). 
Nevertheless, on the basis of current market pricing, the ERP project costs of other 
United Nations organizations and advice sought from industry sources, it is 
estimated that a total of $285.6 million (at current rates), including a contingency 
provision (15 per cent of project) amounting to $37.3 million will be required for 
the implementation of an ERP system in the Secretariat over a five-year period. 
These requirements are summarized in table 1 below and the overall explanation of 
each of the components which comprises the total project costs follows below. It 
should be noted that no provision has been made at this stage for potential post-
implementation (maintenance and other support costs) requirements for the new 
ERP system. Due consideration will be given as the project develops and will be 
reported accordingly to the General Assembly in the subsequent annual reports.

 (a) Software licences and customization 
 

55. ERP software vendors can offer a wide range of solutions and pricing 
configurations. Pricing depends on the number and type of licences, interfaces, 
portals and tools for data warehousing and reporting. It is assumed for budgetary 
purposes that the Organization would successfully negotiate a favourable agreement 
for enterprise licences. The total estimated cost for software licences is $15 million. 
Based on guidance from industry advisors and experience of other United Nations 
organizations, the cost for unavoidable software customization to be undertaken by 
the software vendor is projected at the same level as the licence cost ($15 million). 
Accordingly, it is estimated that the software licences and customization component 
of the project would amount to $30 million.  
 

 (b) Integration costs 
 

56. Integration costs cover wide-ranging activities for designing, building and 
rolling out the ERP solution in all functional areas: 

 (a) Design includes linkages with business processes re-engineering and 
organizational change; 

 (b) Building involves configuring ERP solutions to meet specific user 
requirements; 

 (c) Roll-out entails legacy data migration and testing solutions on the 
technology infrastructure.  

57. Based on specialized advice and lessons learned from the development and 
implementation of IMIS, integration presents some of the largest cost elements of a 
new ERP system. Consequently, the integration services required for the Secretariat, 
including offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions and field missions 
are estimated at $128.7 million. 
 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 20 
 

 (c) Project and change management 
 

58. The ERP project team would be responsible for identification of requirements, 
process re-engineering, software configuration and implementation of the various 
releases. A project team consisting of 44 temporary posts (1 D-2, 6 D-1, 12 P-5, 
13 P-4, 5 P-3, 7 General Service (Other level)) as reflected in figure III below would 
be required for the duration of the implementation of the ERP system. The project 
team would carry out the following functions:  

 (a) Identification of requirements suitable for software selection; 

 (b) ERP software evaluation and selection; 

 (c) Business process standardization, streamlining and re-engineering and 
adoption of best practices; 

 (d) Change management and communications; 

 (e) Software configuration and software customization, as a last resort; 

 (f) Development of temporary and permanent interfaces; 

 (g) Evaluation and coordination of ICT infrastructure requirements to enable 
efficient data interchange; 

 (h) Data cleansing, conversion and reference table preparation; 

 (i) Report specification, design and development; 

 (j) User training in all locations; 

 (k) Procurement and acquisition support for system integration and software; 

 (l) Project planning, management and administrative support, including 
management of consultancy contracts. 

59. The Project Director, at the D-2 level, would be responsible for the overall 
management of the project, including change management, process management, 
technology architecture and project administration, and for supervising the work 
carried out by the four functional teams in the areas of human resources, supply 
chain, finance and budget, and central support services. The Project Director would 
be assisted by a Project Assistant (General Service (Other level)) who will provide 
project and administrative support to the project management team.

60. The temporary posts proposed for change management (1 P-5, 1 P-3, 1 GS 
(OL)) would focus on assessing the impact of the ERP system on staff and 
management, designing and implementing a strategy for support activities in areas 
such as communication, organizational development, and training to promote a 
smooth transition. A communications programme would be aimed at making all staff 
aware of ERP, its goals and objectives, impact on work, and keeping the user 
community at large up-to-date, including through the development and maintenance 
of a website. 

61. Two temporary posts are proposed for process management (1 D-1, 1 P-5). The 
Process Management Coordinator (D-1) will lead business process improvement 
initiatives that will be required in the implementation of ERP and will be 
responsible for the overall quality assurance for the project. He/she will be 
supported by a Senior Project Officer (Risk Management). The process management 
staff will plan the scope and timing of the milestone reviews and manage them. 

62. The temporary posts proposed for technology management (1 D-1, 1 P-5) 
would deal with activities encompassing the definition of the enterprise-wide ICT 
architecture, setting technical standards, projecting enterprise-wide ERP needs, 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 22 
 

evaluating the suitability of infrastructure operations and identifying gaps between 
existing infrastructure and ERP requirements, and provide expertise and guidance 
during the implementation phase.  

63. The temporary posts proposed for administrative management (1 P-5, 1 P-4, 
1 GS (OL)) would ensure that resources are efficiently utilized, monitored and 
reported accordingly. The functions to be carried out include certifying funds, 
monitoring budget performance, preparing budget estimates and performance 
reports, providing administrative support to the ERP team, ensuring that contractual 
arrangements are fulfilled, including compliance of the various commercial 
contracts as well as monitoring quality assurance and resolving contract variation 
issues. 

64. A total of 32 temporary posts are proposed to staff the four functional teams 
representing human resources, supply chain, finance and central support services. 
Each team would be headed by a Team Leader (D-1) and is accountable to the 
Project Director. Each team will be supported by two senior analysts (P-5), three 
ERP functional experts (P-4), one ICT officer (P-3) and one ICT assistant (General 
Service (Other level)). Each team is responsible for defining the functionality 
requirements of the Secretariat worldwide, and for the implementation of a new 
global ERP system within the area of expertise in coordination with business owners 
and heads of departments or offices. In particular, each team will: 

 (a) Lead, supervise and carry out a detailed analysis of key functional 
processes and related functionalities at the Secretariat, offices away from 
Headquarters, tribunals and peacekeeping operations worldwide; 

 (b) Coordinate the work carried out by different specialists and subject 
matter experts within and across each functional team; 

 (c) Formulate and implement the substantive work programme for the team; 
oversee the management of activities undertaken, ensuring that programmed 
activities are carried out in an effective and timely manner; 

 (d) Provide expert guidance related to process re-engineering and ensure 
validation of outcomes by all stakeholders; 

 (e) Collaborate with the technology team in the determination of the 
functional fit of competing ERP software and the evaluation of interoperability with 
existing software;  

 (f) Contribute to the development and implementation of a change 
management plan and the development of relevant user training modules and 
manuals. 

65. Change management is a critical element of a successful ERP implementation. 
A structured change approach improves the chances of project success by ensuring 
“buy-in” on the part of all stakeholders at every stage of the process. This “buy-in” 
can be achieved through use of a communication strategy, creating project 
champions, improving transparency, identification of and addressing major 
obstacles to implementation such as staff resistance and development of an effective 
means to ensure sustainable behavioural changes. Process improvement, 
communication and other approaches for effecting change are essential, enabling 
broad input and participation which ensures ownership of decisions by programme 
managers and other relevant staff. 



 A/62/510/Rev.1
 

23 08-30226 
 

 (d) Training 
 

66. It is expected that over 10,000 staff members will require training at duty 
stations worldwide. Training modes would include online learning and “train the 
trainer” programmes. The latter training programme serves the dual purpose of 
reducing overall costs and building critical internal capacity at duty stations. Key 
determinants of overall training costs include the current employee skill set, 
responsibility level, modes of training delivery and timing of training programmes. 
Accordingly, a provision of $37 million is sought for that purpose. 
 

 (e) Operational costs 
 

67. Provision amounting to $4.7 million is sought to cover general operating 
expenses, furniture and equipment as well as supplies and materials required in 
connection with the proposed establishment of the 44 posts for the ERP project 
team.  
 

 (f) Contingency provision 
 

68. In formulating the total project requirements, an independent review was 
sought as a means of validating the amounts to be sought. However, notwithstanding 
the external review, uncertainty arises in any large-scale project over the life of its 
implementation. Accordingly, contingency provision has been an accepted fiscal 
planning tool for managing the risk of cost escalations and covering potential cost 
estimate shortfalls. In determining the percentage amount to be proposed for 
contingency, independent advice based on experiences of global ERP 
implementations recommended a range of 10-25 per cent. In the present proposals, a 
contingency factor of 15 per cent of the total of the individual components described 
above has been used as the basis of calculation for the contingency provision of 
$37.3 million. Recourse to the contingency provision during the life of the project 
implementation will be reported accordingly to the General Assembly in the annual 
reports. 
 
 

 G. Risk management 
 
 

69. A preliminary analysis on risks presented here provides a starting point for 
more detailed and structured examination, including the use of risk assessment 
services, which will be engaged through a competitive procurement process. 
 

 1. Operational risk 
 

70. One of the key objectives of the ERP project is to implement best practice 
processes. During process changes that affect planning and resource allocation, 
critical support to current operations will be at risk. The Secretariat’s goal for ERP 
is to build an integrated global system, which includes all financial, human and 
physical resource processes at Secretariat locations globally. Operational entities 
will need to redirect efforts to ERP implementation to support business processes re-
engineering, design of the new system, preparation of legacy data, and rolling out 
the new application. The impact of failing to provide critical support to operations 
adversely affects the achievement of mandates.  



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 24 
 

71. Given competing priorities, business owners will need to plan well in advance 
and carefully assign resources to ensure that operational and ERP tasks are 
accomplished. Backstopping specific operational needs during implementation will 
mitigate the identified risk. 
 

 2. Financial risk 
 

72. The decision to replace IMIS with the ERP system could place financial 
integrity at risk during transition. Replacement will be complicated owing to eight 
separate IMIS installations, each with interconnections with other legacy systems 
and significant data not held in IMIS. The number of connections and proportion of 
data are high and accordingly the impact of financial risk is high. In the case of 
failure, a range of alternatives would be activated incurring time and cost penalties, 
which heighten the sensitivity of financial risk. 

73. Financial risk will be mitigated by taking a systematic approach in making 
IPSAS policies operational through tripartite efforts by the IPSAS project, business 
areas and the ERP project. Additional mitigation measures involve development of 
legacy transitional arrangements. Where specific functionalities cannot be fully 
deployed in time, interim arrangements will be made for IPSAS compliance within 
existing systems. That effort will be complemented by support from technology 
owners in facilitating data migration and any necessary temporary interfaces with 
legacy systems. 
 

 3. Reputation risk 
 

74. The Organization’s reputation will be enhanced by achieving IPSAS 
compliance competently and without qualification. The provisions of section IV, 
paragraph 2, of General Assembly resolution 60/283 are being applied and IPSAS 
implementation timings are realistically synchronized with the introduction of the 
ERP system. Contingent on having the IPSAS required modules of ERP in place by 
the end of 2010, future financial statements shall be based on progressive 
incorporation of IPSAS standards, starting with those for the period ending 
31 December 2011. However, if the funding proposal for the ERP project is not 
approved by the General Assembly at its resumed sixty-second session, it will not be 
possible for the Secretariat to deploy IPSAS-compliant functionalities by the end of 
2010, resulting in the Secretariat failing to meet the expectations of Member States 
and the public. A communication plan for engaging external stakeholders will be 
developed for IPSAS implementation in conjunction with other key reform 
initiatives, including enterprise resource management. 
 

 4. Time and budget risks 
 

75. Completing the project on time and within budget is put at risk by the usual 
procedures for cross-organizational consultations and decision-making. The 
likelihood of time and budget risks is high and is demonstrated by reviewed 
performance of other project activities by the Secretariat. Similarly demonstrated 
are the high impact and sensitivity of time and budget overruns. 

76. Mitigation of time and budget risks will be by exceptional handling of ERP 
issues in cross-organizational consultations and decision-making. Concurrent 
activities will be boxed into a period of time defined by key milestones and capped 
by a total cost, which shall not be exceeded during the time box. All internal 



 A/62/510/Rev.1
 

25 08-30226 
 

stakeholders will be unified in committing to the time-boxing milestones set 
separately in the implementation plan. It is expected that strong commitment will 
also be demonstrated in prompt decision-making and responsiveness in supporting 
project activities.  
 

 5. Technical quality risks 
 

77. The capacities of internal expertise do not cover all specific competencies of 
ERP implementation and risk technical quality. Technical quality affects the upgrade 
effort and longer-term utility of the new system and therefore has a high impact. The 
wide range of technical aspects and complexity of interdependencies result in a high 
likelihood of risk. Technical failure would cause the project to fall short of replacing 
legacy systems with a next-generation system and therefore sensitivity is high. 
Technical quality risks will be mitigated by selecting competent external system 
integrators with extensive ERP implementation experience and, on an as-needed 
basis, using independent third-party expertise for evaluating and validating key 
technical decisions throughout the project period. 
 

 6. Commercial performance risks 
 

78. Current procurement procedures and contractual arrangements place at risk the 
commercial performance required of ERP implementation partners. The duration 
and global reach of implementation heighten the likelihood and impact of 
commercial performance risk. High sensitivity of that risk is a direct consequence of 
heavy reliance on commercial services, particularly for systems integration. 
Mitigating commercial performance risk will include undertaking thorough due 
diligence efforts during the request-for-proposals process and engaging legal advice 
to determine contractual arrangements that assign the risk burden in the best 
interests of the Organization. 
 
 

 H. Financing arrangements 
 
 

79. The main value of the enterprise resource planning system will be that it 
provides an opportunity to streamline and improve the operations of the entire 
Organization through process-re-engineering, sharing of common data and 
implementation of best practices and standards. As the ERP system encompasses all 
administrative activities of the Organization, namely finance and budget 
management, human resources management, supply chain management, central 
support services, and other core services, due consideration has been given to the 
appropriate channels of funding for the project, as its financing should not be solely 
restricted to the regular budget. In this connection, it is proposed that the ERP be 
financed from among the main sources of funds, namely the regular budget, 
peacekeeping and extrabudgetary resources in the following percentages: 15 per 
cent from the regular budget; 62 per cent from the peacekeeping support account; 
and 23 per cent from the special accounts for programme support costs to which are 
credited overhead income generated by expenditures relating to technical 
cooperation, and to general trust funds as well as reimbursement for administrative 
support provided by the Organization to extrabudgetary entities such as the United 
Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children’s Fund, and so 
forth. That formula is based on the distribution of 2008-2009 estimated resources 
between the regular budget, peacekeeping activities and technical cooperation and 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 26 
 

general trust funds and administrative support provided by the Organization to 
extrabudgetary entities, proportioned against the total ERP project cost. 

80. Under that arrangement, the overall estimated cost of the ERP project 
($285,560,600 at current rates), inclusive of the contingency provision of 
$37,247,000 would be distributed as indicated in table 2 below. The contingency 
provision shared between the three sources of funding would amount to $5,587,000 
under the regular budget, $23,093,200 under the peacekeeping support account and 
$8,566,800 under the extrabudgetary resources. It is proposed that the contingency 
provision be financed immediately in 2008-2009.

 a For 2008-2009, amount relates to the peacekeeping period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009 and 
first six months of the subsequent period. 

 
 

81. Of the total estimated amount for the project for the biennium 2008-2009 of 
$82,324,300 (at current rates), it is proposed that: (a) an amount of $12,348,600 be 
funded under the regular budget, (b) the amount of $51,041,000 from the 
peacekeeping support account, consisting of $37,355,300 for the period 1 July 2008 
to 30 June 2009 and an amount of $13,685,700 from the subsequent peacekeeping 
support account budget for the period 1 July 2009 to 31 December 2009. At the 
same time, in line with the cost-sharing arrangements, an amount of $18,934,700 
would be provided from extrabudgetary resources. 

82. With respect to the financing of the requirements under the regular budget for 
the biennium 2008-2009, approval is sought to: 

 (a) Utilize the accrued interest income under the IMIS Fund previously 
established for the IMIS project. The current balance at 31 December 2007 amounts 
to $2.346 million. It will be recalled that in its resolution 56/271, the General 
Assembly had authorized the use of accrued interest income to meet requirements of 
IMIS relating to the activities detailed in the report of the Secretary-General 
(A/56/602);  

 (b) Use of the available balances in the surplus account of the United 
Nations General Fund. As at 31 December 2007, the available balance amounts to 
$141.1 million. Accordingly, it is proposed that the balance required for the ERP 
project for the biennium 2008-2009, after consideration of paragraph 82 (a) above 



 A/62/510/Rev.1
 

27 08-30226 
 

amounting to $15.6 million, be funded through the surplus account. This would 
require a suspension of the provisions for the application of credits under 
regulations 3.2 (d), 5.3 and 5.4 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United 
Nations, which would otherwise have to be surrendered pursuant to those 
provisions. 

83. In view of the lifespan of project implementation over a five-year period, it is 
proposed that a multi-year special account be established to record income and 
expenditures for the ERP project. It will be recalled that similar arrangements had 
been authorized in connection with the financial management of the previous IMIS 
project as well as various construction and/or major improvement projects. Funds 
provided for the ERP project and resultant expenditures therefore will be recorded 
in a separate ERP Fund and any unexpended balances will be carried forward into 
succeeding bienniums until the project is completed. Interest earned on the ERP 
Fund will be credited to that Fund. 
 
 

 IV. Complementary systems: what an enterprise resource 
planning system will not cover 
 
 

84. The present section of the report resubmits proposals that had earlier been 
submitted in the report of the General Assembly (A/62/510). The raison d’être of the 
projects remains unchanged and hence has effectively been repeated. The financial 
requirements have, however, been updated to reflect current rates as well as a 
modified funding period. 

85. The ERP system will provide the Organization with the required tools to 
effectively plan, allocate, monitor and report the flow of resources globally. It will 
also add efficiency through the streamlining, standardization and automation of 
administrative processes. 

86. However, an ERP system, in and of itself, will not address all inefficiencies. 
Nor will it ensure the quality of the “products” developed and delivered by the 
United Nations Secretariat. Of particular relevance to the Secretariat are two areas 
which absorb significant resources: (a) the delivery of services and (b) the creation, 
preservation, dissemination, archival and disposal of documents and other 
information in a variety of media. 
 
 

 A. Managing services: customer relationship management 
 
 

87. While the ERP system will streamline and automate the core financial, 
administrative and management operations, the CRM system will deal with the 
specific processes connected with providing day-to-day services for end-users, 
which are not usually dealt with by an ERP system. 

88. The primary objective of a CRM system is to improve the quality and cost-
effectiveness of services provided to end-users, which includes a wide range of 
customers and constituents. 

89. While ERP focuses on the flow of resources throughout the Organization at the 
macro level, CRM addresses the detailed processes involved in the provision of 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 28 
 

specific services for specific end-users. The following are examples of how these 
two systems relate with each other: 

 (a) While the acquisition of computers or furniture will be dealt with in an 
ERP system, the assignment of such assets to specific individuals will be handled by 
the CRM system; 

 (b) While the overall inventory and the costs of maintaining equipment in 
working condition will be managed by the ERP system, the detailed process of 
maintaining a specific item, such as identifying the need for a repair, executing the 
repair, and tracking the assignment of the item to an individual technician, will be 
handled by the CRM system; 

 (c) While human resources will be managed at a higher level by the ERP 
system, the workforce management for service-related activities will be managed at 
a micro level within the CRM system. 

90. The CRM system will be very important in large offices, where the high 
number of users and the variety and complexity of services provided demand 
efficient methods to optimize the use of available resources. In the field, however, 
the provision of services to civilian and military personnel acquires a critical 
dimension, as the field mission is likely to be the sole provider of basic and often 
vital day-to-day services.  

91. Resources required for the implementation of CRM relate to three specific 
priority areas. These cover facilities and Member States services management, 
peacekeeping troop contribution management, and peacekeeping 
telecommunications billing. Given the nature of these three areas, it is proposed that 
the costs related to facilities and Member States services management would be 
borne by the regular budget, while the costs related to the other two areas would be 
borne by the peacekeeping support account. The costs associated with these three 
areas are summarized in table 3 below. Further information on the implementation 
of the CRM system in these areas is detailed in annex I to the present report.

93. Of the total estimated amount required for the CRM project ($8,221,000), it is 
proposed that the amount of $1,510,900 under section 28A, Office of the Under-
Secretary-General for Management, of the programme budget for the biennium 
2008-2009, be funded through the balance in the surplus account of the United 
Nations General Fund. This would require a suspension to the provisions of 
regulations 3.2 (d), 5.3 and 5.4 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United 
Nations. In addition, it is proposed that the remaining amount of $6,710,100 be 
funded from the peacekeeping support account distributed as follows: (a) an amount 
of $5,046,700 under the peacekeeping operations support account for the period 
1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009, and (b) an amount of $1,663,400 to be funded under 
the subsequent peacekeeping support account budget proposals for the period 1 July 
2009 to 30 June 2010. 
 
 

 B. Managing knowledge: enterprise content management system 
 
 

94. The ECM system can be seen as the counterpart of ERP for the substantive 
areas of the Organization. While ERP deals with resources (people and financial 
assets), ECM addresses information assets of a substantive nature. 

95. In common with most organizations, the Secretariat has much more 
“unstructured” information than “structured” information. Figure IV provides a 
summary of what typically constitutes unstructured information and its importance 
and volume within an organization such as the Secretariat:

08-30226 30 
 

  Figure IV 
Summary of structured and unstructured content 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

96. In a knowledge-intensive organization where information is a key enterprise 
asset and enabler, ECM is recognized as a core competency and capability. Loss of 
information or inability to access it can be crippling for most organizations. An 
ECM system addresses these fundamental requirements in many ways: 

 (a) The ECM system brings structure to unstructured content, by requiring 
the entry of certain data-attributes called “metadata” for every document or other 
form of content that is created and stored; 

 (b) By establishing clear ownership of content and audit trails of access and 
reuse of content, the ECM system can provide unmatched security for information 
assets and enable the Secretariat to reliably provide access to information, internally 
and externally, to increase the transparency of its operations. Member States, 
Permanent Missions, partners, telecommuters, and so on, can be provided secure 
access to relevant information from any location; 

 (c) The ECM system will provide an efficient records management system 
that meets mandated standards for archiving and disposing enterprise content; 

 (d) Optimizing the management of content through version control and reuse 
of existing content, will make the content volume more manageable and help the 
Secretariat to contain the storage growth rate which is outstripping industry 
averages, resulting in high costs for storage infrastructure and recurring costs for 
storage and backup; 

 (e) The ECM system also facilitates knowledge-sharing within the 
Secretariat and with other international organizations, non-governmental 
organizations and the public at large through its capabilities for the creation and 
dissemination of content on internal and external websites; 

 (f) By providing a simple, browser-based capacity to create content, it 
empowers staff with minimal ICT skills to create and manage dynamic content of 
both internal and external websites; 



 A/62/510/Rev.1
 

31 08-30226 
 

 (g) By standardizing web content authoring, the ECM system can easily 
enforce Secretariat standards for visual content, such as user interfaces, accessibility 
requirements, and facilitate the branding of internal and external websites; 

 (h) The ECM system can rigorously enforce security and control over the 
release of information to websites, especially external websites. For example, the 
release of content simultaneously in all the official languages could be automatically 
enforced; 

 (i) The ECM system will enable website administrators to manage multiple 
global sites (United Nations Headquarters, offices away from Headquarters, etc.). 

97. The examples listed above clearly indicate the benefits of an ECM solution as 
an effective knowledge-sharing facility. In the field, an ECM system constitutes an 
indispensable complement to ERP. Peacekeeping and political missions conduct 
business with local entities largely based on paper transactions. The ability to 
digitize, classify, store and electronically link these documents to ERP ensures the 
integrity of financial transactions. In that connection, several reports of the Office of 
Internal Oversight Services have highlighted the poor mechanisms which exist today 
to ensure proper asset and financial controls in the field. 

98. Resources required for the implementation of the ECM relate to priority areas 
covering the Official Documents System (ODS), the United Nations Internet site, 
collaboration capabilities, the peacekeeping reporting process automation and 
guidance content repository as well as overall ECM governance. Given the nature of 
these areas, it is proposed that the costs related to ODS and the United Nations 
Internet site would be borne by the regular budget, while the costs related to the 
peacekeeping reporting process automation and guidance content repository would 
be borne by the peacekeeping support account. The costs related to the other areas 
(ECM governance and collaboration capabilities) would be equally shared between 
the regular budget and peacekeeping support account. The costs associated with the 
above-mentioned areas are summarized in table 5 below. Further information on the 
implementation of the ECM system in those areas is detailed in annex II to the 
present report.

100. Of the total estimated amount required for the ECM project of $14,992,100, it 
is proposed that the General Assembly approve under section 28A, Office of the 
Under-Secretary-General for Management, of the programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009, an amount of $4,203,600 to be funded from the surplus 
account of the United Nations General Fund. This would require a suspension of 
regulations 3.2 (d), 5.3 and 5.4 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United 
Nations. In addition it is proposed that the balance of the project costs amounting to 
$10,788,500 be funded under the peacekeeping operations support account budget 
for the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009 ($8,438,600) and the subsequent 
peacekeeping support account budget for the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 
($2,349,900). 
 
 

 V. Conclusion 
 
 

101. The present report sets forth the Secretary-General’s vision of the role that ICT 
can play in transforming the way the Secretariat works. In accordance with that 
vision, there is a need to simplify and streamline rules, policies, and processes so 
that the Secretariat is not totally mired in process, but becomes proactive, 
responsive and results-oriented. The enterprise systems proposed — ERP, CRM, and 
ECM system — in the present report will make that vision achievable, and have the 



 A/62/510/Rev.1
 

33 08-30226 
 

potential of serving as the engine for supporting management reform and 
modernizing the Organization.  

102. Strategic ICT capabilities of the Secretariat lag behind other organizations 
owing to systemic under-investments for Organization-wide purposes. As a result, 
the Secretariat has not been able to fully leverage ICT in a manner that enables the 
entire Organization to benefit from its potential. The recent Secretariat-wide ICT 
strategic planning has revealed acute needs for improving the management of 
institutional knowledge and resources in the context of global operations of the 
Secretariat. These three enterprise systems are critical and integral parts of the new 
comprehensive ICT strategy for the Secretariat. 

103. However, it is not only a matter of simplifying processes. Current systems are 
at the breaking point, and woefully inadequate for carrying out the increasingly 
complex, far-reaching operations of the Organization. It is urgent that the Secretariat 
proceed with building core modern information management systems that can 
sustain the vastly increased operations the United Nations is undertaking across the 
globe.  

104. While the resources required are considerable, but so are the long-term 
benefits to the Secretariat. What is clear is the overwhelming need to embark on 
these projects without delay, in order to better equip the Secretariat to successfully 
meet the increasing demands and commitments and achieving efficiency gains 
across the board. It is an investment for the future. 
 
 

 VI. Summary of resource requirements for the enterprise 
systems for the United Nations Secretariat worldwide and 
request for action to be taken by the General Assembly 
 
 

 A. Summary of resource requirements 
 
 

105. The following table summarizes the resource requirements (net of staff 
assessment) for the ERP, CRM and ECM projects proposed in the present report. It 
is estimated that a total of $308.8 million (at current rates) will be required for the 
implementation of ERP ($285.6 million, including a contingency provision of 
$37.3 million), CRM ($8.2 million) and ECM ($15 million) projects. 

106. The total amount for the biennium 2008-2009 is estimated at $140.8 million 
and would be required to implement ERP ($119.6 million, including a contingency 
provision of $37.3 million), CRM ($7.4 million) and ECM ($13.8 million). 

107. It is proposed to fund the regular budget portion of the project under section 
28A, Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management, of the programme 
budget for the biennium 2008-2009 from the combination of the use of interest 
accrued, and from the surplus account of the General Fund. In that connection, an 
amount of $2.3 million from interest accrued under the Integrated Management 
Information System Fund available at 31 December 2007 would be used to fund the 
requirements of the ERP project. In addition, the General Assembly would be 
requested to decide that the provisions for the application of credits under 
regulations 3.2 (d), 5.3 and 5.4 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 34 
 

Nations shall be suspended in respect of the amount of $21.6 gross ($21.3 million 
net), which otherwise would have to be surrendered pursuant to those provisions. 

108. The remaining requirements for 2008-2009 would be funded from the 
peacekeeping support account ($89.6 million) and extrabudgetary resources 
($27.5 million).

Annex I 
 

  Customer relationship management system 
 
 

1. The procurement of leading CRM software has recently been completed. 
Using this software, ICT Service Management and Facilities Service Management, 
United Nations Headquarters, are expected to be implemented within 12 months, to 
urgently replace current aging systems. 

2. All the central ICT service providers within the Secretariat, ITSD/Department 
of Management, the Communications and Information Technology Service, 
Department of Field Support and the seven offices away from Headquarters, have 
agreed to adopt standardized business processes using the ICT Infrastructure Library 
(ITIL), an industry best practice, as the basis for managing their ICT services and to 
implement the CRM software with little or no customization. Effectively, this means 
that the software will be ready for implementation in all duty stations and 
peacekeeping missions, after the initial implementation in New York using a 
centralized model, whenever technically feasible.  

3. Although no additional software development will be needed for the 
implementation of ICT Service Management in other duty stations, each 
implementation involves considerable effort in migrating current data to the new 
software, changing the current business processes and workflows, retraining staff 
and managing the project. The Secretariat will adopt a cautious and phased approach 
to replacing existing ICT Service Management systems over a period of two years, 
after implementation in New York. Resource requirements for implementation at 
further locations will be considered in the context of the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 2010-2011.  

4. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has 
already undertaken a detailed business process review of all its facilities related 
operations. The use of the central CRM system will provide an opportunity to 
implement the revised business processes and, depending on lessons learned from 
the implementation in New York and ESCAP, facilities management services will be 
sought to be standardized at all duty stations. 
 
 

  Customer relationship management in peacekeeping operations 
 
 

5. Currently approximately 40 per cent of the peacekeeping budget is allocated to 
establishing military and police capacity in support of mission mandates. Military 
capacity is achieved through the provision of equipment, personnel and capacity by 
troop-contributing countries, and requires verification of that capacity and 
appropriate reimbursement for it. Similarly, Member States provide civilian police 
components of peacekeeping operations either as individual civilian police 
personnel or formed police units. The management of the military and police 
capacity in field missions is a significant undertaking in terms of scale and 
complexity and integrates the disciplines of finance, logistics as well as strategic 
and tactical military and police operations. The service management components of 
these operations will be automated using CRM technology. The project will focus on 
the management of the lifecycle of activities required to manage and sustain military 
and police capacity in field missions.

6. At present, the telephone billing review, approval and cost recovery process is 
highly manual and time-consuming. Analysis of call data is difficult and tracking of 
the process is cumbersome. In several field missions and in some offices away from 
Headquarters, this process has been automated using a variety of automation tools, 
but a single global system does not exist. The Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations intends to implement an end-to-end standard automated telephone billing 
process supported by CRM technology that will provide increased accuracy, greater 
accountability and transparency of the process. The scope of the project is expected 
to include the automated calculations of calls and costs, clearly defined routing and 
approvals, and interfaces with telephone switches and financial systems for 
electronic payment and recovery resulting in savings in time and efficiency.  

7. The proposed system will be initially implemented for the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support at United Nations 
Headquarters, followed by an extension to one or two field missions after 
performance testing. CITS and ITSD will work closely during the requirements-
gathering process to ensure that the solution developed can introduce a standardized 
process across the Secretariat at all duty stations.  

8. Another key constituency for the CRM system will be the Permanent 
Missions. Leveraging the CRM system for other services, United Nations 
Headquarters and ESCAP will jointly explore the possibility of building a Member 
States relationship management capacity from both the Headquarters and field 
perspectives. The project’s initial focus will be on the analysis of the interaction of 
Member States with the Secretariat and the gathering of requirements, to develop a 
“To Be” set of processes, in consultation with Member States, through the Working 
Group on Informatics, which has been advocating such efforts.

Annex II 
 

  Enterprise content management system 
 
 

1. The ECM system will be a foundation for consolidating several discrete 
systems that manage the creation, storage and distribution of content. The migration 
of current systems to an ECM “platform” will be undertaken over several years, 
prioritizing them on criticality for business continuity, potential for cost-savings or 
efficiency gains, and compliance requirements. On this basis, a few important 
projects have been identified for the initial rollout of ECM. 

2. The Official Documents System (ODS) requires upgrading technologically as 
soon as possible. Migration to an ECM platform will make it more robust in its 
performance and availability 24 by 7, improve controls over the simultaneous 
publication of documents in all official languages, and eliminate several 
cumbersome processes in document handling from multiple duty stations. Further, 
ODS requires upgrading functionally to allow authoring departments and offices, 
regardless of geographic location, to collaborate on creation and approval of 
documents, with detailed audit trails of the review, approvals and translations.  

3. Initially, a functionally and technically re-engineered ODS will be prototyped 
in a lab environment, using a commercial ECM solution. This will enable the 
Secretariat to standardize the business processes for official documents and embark 
on an automation of these processes in a later phase. 

4. The United Nations Internet site, www.un.org, requires migration migrated to 
the ECM platform expeditiously as it has become difficult to manage both 
functionally and technically, owing to the myriad tools and technologies that sustain 
its current state. The site has evolved over nearly a decade with mainly incremental 
enhancements; a technological upgrade is necessary for the site to meet the 
increasing expectations about both its content and its availability.  

5. A standard content management system across authoring departments and 
offices will enable the Department of Public Information to enforce global policies 
for content creation, publishing and security, standards for presentation and 
compliance with accessibility requirements, in line with best practices for 
distributed content management. Such a system will improve the controls, for 
example, over the release of content to the live environment in all official languages 
simultaneously, or the retirement of obsolete content. 

6. The first phase of the migration of the United Nations Internet website will 
include the creation of the technical infrastructure and the implementation of web 
content management in the Department of Public Information and other department 
offices in United Nations Headquarters that directly contribute their content to the 
United Nations website. 

7. Another priority is to exploit the collaboration capabilities of ECM. These can 
help Member States and delegations in many of their consultative processes that 
involve secure, web-based exchange of documents and ideas. Features such as 
threaded discussions, instant messaging, quick polling, version control and audit 
trails to track changes, workflows for approval, and so on, can facilitate the 
coordination of formal and informal agendas and the drafting of resolutions and 
other outputs of all committees and working groups. Electronic team rooms can be 



 A/62/510/Rev.1
 

39 08-30226 
 

created nearly on demand, using standard templates, even during the session of a 
committee or group.  

8. Simple or elaborate content classification can also be enabled to facilitate easy 
retrieval and enhance the institutional memory of the committees and working 
groups. Such content can also be made available securely to the Permanent Missions 
based on access rules that can be established by the committees and working groups. 

9. A successful enterprise-wide implementation of content management requires 
strong governance. Therefore, the Secretariat has decided to adopt an industry 
standard framework, created by the Association of Information and Image 
Management. The framework prescribes a rigorous ECM implementation life cycle. 
One of its prerequisites is a “business classification scheme”, a classification 
scheme based on the business of the organization to be used for organizing, 
accessing, retrieving, storing and managing its information. Such a scheme would 
need to be easy to use, and yet sophisticated enough to meet the diverse needs of the 
Secretariat.  
 
 

  Enterprise content management in peacekeeping operations 
 
 

10. The Department of Field Support, in collaboration with the Department of 
Management (Information Technology Services Division and Archives and Records 
Management Section) is currently developing an ECM road map following a 
strategic analysis of the business needs and the operational and technical 
environment of the Department. This activity will essentially orient the 
Department’s future ECM initiatives and embed sound practices in them and as such 
is a foundational element in embracing an enterprise vision. The lessons learned are 
expected to facilitate the development of similar road maps for other departments.  

11. Following the development of the ECM road map, the Department of Field 
Support will initially address the core document workflows related to the 
observation and reporting activities undertaken in field missions. Many of the core 
functions of military observers, civilian police and substantive functions in field 
missions depend on the gathering of raw data, its consolidation, analysis and finally 
its formulation into meaningful information. In order to ensure that peacekeepers 
have the information they require to fulfil their core functions, to ensure 
information-sharing and greater collaboration and enhanced situational awareness 
(tactical and strategic) among the geographically dispersed peacekeeping 
community, the Department proposes to examine and map the associated processes 
and target an initial implementation in a complex, multifaceted mission in order to 
identify content management requirement links with mandate. Having analysed the 
manner in which mandate drives content and the management of that content, 
repeatable content management models will be developed and applied as appropriate 
to other field missions. 

12. In July 2005, the Peacekeeping Best Practices Section, under the aegis of its 
Guidance Project, developed a guidance development system centred on a robust 
Expanded Senior Management Team supported by policy and procedure. The 
Guidance Project developed a framework of all known activities, numbering in 
excess of 1,200 activity lines. Set against that framework, the Guidance Project has 
sought to populate a database of all known guidance material in the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support with a view to 



A/62/510/Rev.1  
 

08-30226 40 
 

creating a central repository which can act as the focus of institutional knowledge. 
That knowledge is then delivered to staff in the field through the peace operation’s 
Intranet. The ECM solution will facilitate the formulation, enhancement and 
publication of guidance material and can be leveraged to provide both a structured 
repository for the guidance material developed to date, including external web-
based informational resources, and the tools to foster collaboration in and between 
field missions, by providing a shared space for subject matter experts throughout 
peacekeeping field missions.
