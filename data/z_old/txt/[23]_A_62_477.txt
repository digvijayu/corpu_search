  Overview 
 
 

1. The General Assembly, in section XI of its resolution 59/276 of 23 December 
2004, requested the Secretary-General to provide a detailed proposal for a global 
operational framework for information and communications technology (ICT) 
security, business continuity and disaster recovery as outlined in his report on a 
strengthened and unified security management system for the United Nations 
(A/59/365 and Corr.1 and Add.1 and Add.1/Corr.1). In section XV of its resolution 
60/266 of 30 June 2006, the Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to 
submit to it at its resumed sixty-first session a comprehensive report on the 
proposed establishment of and justification for mission on site, mission in theatre 
and off site, and off-site and out-of-theatre redundant data centres for disaster 
recovery and business continuity in peacekeeping missions, as well as on a 
secondary active communications facility and a disaster recovery and business 
continuity centre for information technology.  

2. The present report has been prepared in response to both resolutions and its 
three parts may be summarized as follows:  

 (a) Part one presents a holistic view of disaster recovery and business 
continuity throughout the Secretariat in response to requests made by the General 
Assembly in its resolutions 59/276 and 60/266. Disaster recovery and business 
continuity initiatives at Headquarters, the offices away from Headquarters and field 
missions also address the important requirement of re-enforcing initial 
implementations through the putting in place of two major and centralized data 
centres, in the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and at a proposed 
secondary active site (“site B”), as outlined in paragraphs 8 and 9 and section VI 
below; 

 (b) Part two provides details on a separate but related initiative on 
transferring the current United Nations Headquarters data centre in the Development 
Corporation DC2 building to a facility in Long Island City. The transitioning phase 
of the capital master plan calls for a heavy reliance on the DC2 data centre, a 
facility built in the 1980s and inadequately equipped to handle a full-time mission 
critical function. Details of this proposed alternative approach are presented for the 
review of the General Assembly; 

 (c) Part three summarizes the resource requirements for the implementation 
of parts one and two and also outlines the requested actions by the General 
Assembly. 

3. This report focuses only on the information technology component of disaster 
recovery and business continuity. Other aspects of business continuity as they relate 
to pandemic preparedness are conducted in a separate report submitted to the 
General Assembly (A/62/328).

Secretariat disaster recovery and business continuity 
 
 

 I. Introduction 
 
 

4. In its resolutions 59/276 and 60/266, the General Assembly requested the 
Secretary-General to submit to the Assembly the results of technical studies relating 
to information and communications technology (ICT) security, disaster recovery and 
business continuity planning and to report on disaster recovery and business 
continuity in field missions and on the establishment of a secondary active 
communications facility. The present report addresses these matters and identifies 
the requirements for the development and implementation of a global operational 
framework to enable the Secretariat to respond effectively to emergency situations 
that may impair the operations of critical elements of its ICT infrastructure and 
facilities.  

5. Major enterprise application initiatives such as enterprise resource planning 
(ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise content 
management (ECM) will be implemented as part of an enterprise approach to the 
provision of automated solutions and utilized throughout the Secretariat. These 
centrally hosted and managed systems will require robust and fault-tolerant 
infrastructure. 

6. The organizational scope for this proposal is global, covering the United 
Nations Logistics Base, all peacekeeping missions, all special political missions, 
United Nations Headquarters in New York, the United Nations Offices at Geneva, 
Vienna and Nairobi, the regional commissions, and the International Tribunal for the 
Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia, the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for 
Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law 
Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for 
Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring 
States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, and the International Court of 
Justice. The major focus of the Secretariat’s approach to disaster recovery and 
business continuity and the subsequent resource implications relate to the two major 
data centres that will host enterprise applications and provide backup capabilities to 
all offices away from Headquarters and field missions. At the same time, United 
Nations Headquarters is providing organizational leadership, through coordination, 
standards and increased consolidation of data, to the rest of the Secretariat.  

7. The current level of capability with respect to ICT disaster recovery and 
business continuity differs among the offices enumerated above. Most notably, 
neither United Nations Headquarters nor any of the seven offices away from 
Headquarters or Tribunals are compliant with respect to the most critical 
applications of their respective crisis management plans, as outlined in section IV. 
Resolving this deficiency is a critical component of the overall disaster recovery and 
business continuity strategy. Field missions, are, by necessity, owing to their 
operational environments, well advanced in the implementation of disaster recovery 
and business continuity plans. Owing to the ever-present risk inherent in peace 
operations, disaster recovery and business continuity is a permanent consideration, 



 A/62/477

from the mission planning stages through mission liquidation. Owing to differences 
in environmental stability, the approach to disaster recovery varies with regard to 
the Secretariat, the offices away from Headquarters and field missions. as 
highlighted in the following sections. 

8. The telecommunications hub located in the United Nations Logistics Base at 
Brindisi, Italy, acts as the fulcrum for all ICT activities of field operations. In an 
effort to ensure continuity in cases of widespread disruptions at the United Nations 
Logistics Base, the Department of Field Support is currently in the process of 
establishing a geographically remote secondary active telecommunications facility 
(hereinafter referred to as “site B”) that will provide additional and complimentary 
capacity for the ICT infrastructure currently in place in the United Nations Logistics 
Base and will also be utilized by the Secretariat as a disaster recovery and business 
continuity site and to host enterprise applications. This combined solution is 
presented in part one.  

9. The establishment of a secondary active telecommunications facility is pivotal 
to the successful implementation of the Organization’s disaster recovery and 
business continuity strategy. It will provide the infrastructure necessary to secure 
operations in the event of widespread disruption of the ICT infrastructure upon 
which the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Field 
Support,1 and the United Nations Secretariat rely to ensure secure and reliable 
connectivity among the United Nations Secretariat, United Nations peace 
operations, agencies, funds and programmes. As United Nations peace operations 
evolve into integrated models requiring greater coordination among all United 
Nations entities, the increased reliance on Department of Peacekeeping Operations/ 
Department of Field Support ICT networks must necessarily translate directly into 
an increased need to guarantee the security and reliability of the ICT infrastructure 
that underpins the evolving, complex, integrated model of United Nations peace 
operations and activities. Information on this secondary active communications 
facility is presented in a separate section of this report. 

10. Owing to the differing levels of disaster recovery and business continuity 
capabilities throughout the Secretariat, information on disaster recovery and 
business continuity at United Nations Headquarters and field missions is presented 
in separate sections within this report. Section II provides background information 
on disaster recovery and business continuity for the Secretariat as a whole; section 
III details the expected results of a successful implementation of disaster recovery 
and business continuity plans; section IV provides information on disaster recovery 
and business continuity at Headquarters, offices away from Headquarters and 
Tribunals; and section V details the implementation of disaster recovery and 
business continuity in field missions. Owing to the critical nature of the secondary 
active communications facility, information on the requirement for this capability 
and on the progress in selecting a suitable facility is presented separately, in section VI.

 II. Background 
 
 

 A. Alignment with information and communications technology 
reform initiatives 
 
 

11. The proposal in this report is aligned with the ICT reform strategy that is 
currently being developed by the Chief Information Technology Officer for 
presentation to the General Assembly at its resumed sixty-second session in spring 
2008 and complements the proposal on the enterprise resource planning system 
which will be submitted separately. One of the aims of the disaster recovery and 
business continuity proposal is to establish the requisite technical capacity for the 
implementation of enterprise resource planning and related systems. The proposed 
architecture is purposely designed to provide for a global enterprise resource 
planning architecture by building sufficient data centre capacity. The architecture is 
scalable and plans have been developed in accordance with and in consideration of 
both immediate requirements for disaster recovery and business continuity and the 
necessary provisions for future requirements as indicated in ICT reform proposals. It 
is also in line with the effort to build a stronger enterprise network throughout the 
Secretariat. Ensuring that all of the offices away from Headquarters adhere to the 
same network standards will facilitate the widespread use of the new disaster 
recovery and business continuity facilities.  
 
 

 B. A unified approach 
 
 

12. The present plan reflects a unified approach to ensuring that all disaster 
recovery and business continuity activities are coordinated among Secretariat 
departments to maximize investment, leverage synergies in ICT assets across the 
United Nations Secretariat and achieve economies of scale. The Information 
Technology Services Division has recognized the potential for disaster recovery and 
business continuity throughout the entire Secretariat in the Department of Field 
Support ICT infrastructure. In this capacity, the Information Technology Services 
Division and the Department of Field Support are collaborating to identify 
opportunities and implement viable, scalable and cost-effective solutions so as to 
further leverage Department of Field Support initiatives for the benefit of the entire 
United Nations family. A global disaster recovery and business continuity 
framework is proposed for implementation through: 

 • Utilization of the United Nations Logistics Base as a backup centre for all 
mission- and enterprise-critical Secretariat systems  

 • Establishment of a secondary active communications facility that would be 
used to complement the United Nations Logistics Base, host Secretariat 
enterprise system solutions and provide the capacity to serve as backup centre 
for critical offices away from Headquarters and Tribunal departmental 
applications 

 • Remote access to services and data for all Secretariat duty stations through 
dedicated communication links to these facilities 

 
 



 A/62/477

 C. Disaster recovery and continuity of operations 
 
 

13. Information and communications technology (ICT) plays an integral role in the 
global operations of the Secretariat. The need to ensure timely and secure 
communications and information exchange within and between duty stations is 
central to meeting the core strategic, operational and tactical mandates of United 
Nations missions. Expanding field operations, changing business drivers, new 
technologies and the Organization’s commitment to leveraging ICT has resulted in 
an analogous expansion of ICT infrastructure to support the increased reliance on 
ICT networks and systems used throughout the Organization. Ensuring that a robust 
and fault-tolerant ICT infrastructure is in place to continue or restart operations in 
the event of a natural or man-made disaster or disruption has become a necessary 
and permanent consideration.  

14. Disaster recovery and business continuity strategies have been developed to 
facilitate continuous telecommunications and safeguard the Organization’s data, 
which entail ensuring that resilient and agile ICT infrastructure is in place to 
facilitate continuity of mission-critical operations. In order to mitigate risks to ICT 
assets and infrastructure inherent in the Organization’s operational environment, the 
Secretariat has adopted a strategy that encompasses two separate but related 
components; data backup (disaster recovery) and redundancy (business continuity). 
The proposed framework is purposefully designed to address these operational 
requirements. 
 
 

 D. Potential disruptions 
 
 

15. Disaster recovery and business continuity planning and implementation have 
gained prominence in the commercial, military and governmental sectors in recent 
years. In the commercial sector, estimates indicate that some companies spend up to 
25 per cent of their budget on disaster recovery plans in order to avoid bigger losses. 
Of companies that have had a major loss of computerized records, 43 per cent never 
reopen, 51 per cent close within two years, and only 6 per cent survive long-term.2 
The Secretariat’s ICT infrastructure and assets are subject to greater risks, as United 
Nations peace operations are often conducted within very unstable operational, 
social and political environments that are constantly under threat from both natural 
and man-made disasters and interruptions. The sphere of potential disruptions has 
expanded to include hacker attacks on networks, physical attacks on United Nations 
premises, and broad-based power outages such as those experienced on the east 
coast of the United States of America and in Italy in 2003. These interruptions can 
result from a number of accidental, malicious or environmental events such as: 

 1. Natural disasters including flooding, earthquakes and hurricanes 

 2. Fire 

 3. Power outages 

 4. Armed conflict/civil unrest 

 5. Organized or deliberate disruptions

 6. System and/or equipment failures 

 7. Human error 

 8. Computer viruses/worms 

16.  The planned disaster recovery and business continuity approach is based on 
three considerations: 

 • Prevention: the establishment of robust security measures to prevent hacking, 
virus attacks and unauthorized physical access 

 • Mitigation: the limitation/containment of impacts resulting from a single 
incident through such initiatives as load-balanced ICT facilities  

 • Recovery: ensuring that suitable ICT facilities are available to restore critical 
data and infrastructure as and when required in the most cost-effective and 
operationally viable manner.  

17. While the risk to telecommunications in the event of a disaster or disruption 
can be mitigated to a great degree through redundancy, securing and recovering 
critical data present a greater challenge. In order to meet this challenge, the 
Organization is ensuring that all critical data are backed up and secured and are 
easily accessible. However, this introduces a greater degree of complexity and 
places a considerable strain on communication links, given that data are often stored 
in multiple repositories located on servers in duty stations and within the theatres of 
operation of field missions. In the absence of Secretariat-wide enterprise systems, 
disparate data storage has evolved over time within United Nations offices and 
peace operations. The Secretariat is in the process of replacing these localized 
systems with centralized, enterprise solutions serving all duty stations hosted in 
site B and backed up in the United Nations Logistics Base. This solution will reduce 
local backup requirements, improve efficiency and ensure high availability.  

18. The Board of Auditors reviewed the disaster recovery and business continuity 
plan of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in 2004 and recommended that 
the Department should continue to implement the plan as a matter of priority. The 
report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations3 was 
submitted to the General Assembly which, in its resolution 59/264 B of 22 June 
2005, took note of the observations and endorsed the recommendations contained 
therein. Similar priority was emphasized by the Board of Auditors during its review 
of information and communications technology in the United Nations Organizations 
in New York in February 2007 when a recommendation was made to address single 
points of failure by establishing a contingency plan to ensure the continuity of 
telecommunications with offices away from headquarters in case of such failure.  
 
 

 E. Existing capability 
 
 

19. The Secretary-General’s Crisis Management Plan for Headquarters, developed 
in April 2003 by the Emergency Task Force, provided policy direction and 
performance criteria for advancing the operational requirements for a collective 
disaster recovery and business continuity strategy. Assessment of the Organization’s

capability with respect to the Crisis Management Plan identified deficiencies in 
respect of  measures that had not yet been implemented or funded. These 
deficiencies and the requirements for overcoming them are detailed in this report. 
The initial focus, however, was limited in scope, scale and function to addressing 
threats relating to scenarios one and two of the Crisis Management Plan. Under 
scenario one: a limited impact emergency, an incident or event within the United 
Nations complex or nearby causes an interruption in the normal course of business 
for a short period of time. Under scenario two: the office site becomes unusable, 
an incident or event within the United Nations complex or nearby disrupts the 
normal course of business for an unspecified period of time and calls for evacuation 
of the United Nations premises. 

20. Funding for implementation of disaster recovery and business continuity 
measures has been uneven across the Secretariat. In general, the investments in the 
offices away from Headquarters have largely been limited to better data storage and 
off-site backup. Recent projects are aimed at building more redundancy and backup 
for local systems through the construction of secondary local data centres. For 
peacekeeping and political missions, the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, 
Italy, provides disaster recovery capability. All the investments in disaster recovery 
and business continuity have yielded measurable results, affording, in most cases, 
99 per cent availability of services as tested against “real-life” incidents, including 
the recent power outage affecting the north-east region of the United States. 
Likewise, the value of these investments has been evidenced on a global scale with 
a variety of incidents reported by various duty stations, such as the recent crisis in 
Lebanon.  

21. The present proposal aims to fully utilize existing investments and extend the 
current capability while taking into account new ICT reform initiatives. 
 
 

 III. Expected results 
 
 

22. Many of the duty stations included in the organizational scope of this project 
are not currently compliant with the requirements for scenarios three and four of the 
Crisis Management Plan. Under scenario three: office locations and surrounding 
area become unusable, incidents or events render much of office complex and the 
surrounding areas unreachable or unusable for an indefinite period of time. While 
some staff might be available to deliver critical functions, most physical 
infrastructure and support functions would be seriously impaired. Under this 
scenario, alternative worksites and staff accommodation may be needed on an 
interim basis. Under scenario four: the duty station and large portions of the 
host country are affected by a major catastrophic incident, incidents or events 
lead to widespread loss of life and destruction, rendering the region uninhabitable 
for an extended period of time. This scenario dictates that most functions would 
have to be resumed, at least for a temporary period of time, at alternative locations 
elsewhere in the world, involving alternate staff or the transfer of the affected office 
staff to these locations. 

23. From an ICT disaster recovery and business continuity capability perspective, 
scenarios three and four envisage the following: 

 • The ability to maintain critical ICT services 



A/62/477  
 

07-53440 12 
 

 • Ensuring continuity of key financial transactions 

 • Communications with the staff 

24. The proposal in this report reflects certain underlying principles for global ICT 
operations. The proposal addresses the computing and telecommunication facilities 
that would be required to restart critical operations following a significant disruptive 
episode. The conditions under which such critical operations may restart are 
determined by two factors: (a) recovery time objective and (b) recovery point 
objective.  

25. Recovery time objective is defined as the period following a disruptive event 
after which services covered by the disaster recovery and business continuity plans 
are targeted to restart. Recovery point objective is defined as the currency of the 
data at the time services are to be restarted. Recovery point objective is measured in 
terms of hours/days of data processing lost as a result of the disruptive event. 

26. This proposal is based on ensuring a recovery point objective of 24 hours for 
all critical systems, both local and enterprise-wide. In other words, the processing 
loss at that point will not be greater than 24 hours. The rationale for selecting 24 
hours is explained in section VIII below. For local critical applications, the recovery 
time objective will have to be determined by each office away from Headquarters 
and Tribunal based on their business impact analysis. The extent of a disruption may 
influence how quickly systems can be put back into service.  
 
 

 IV. Disaster recovery and business continuity at Headquarters 
and offices away from Headquarters 
 
 

27. The report of the Secretary-General on the strengthening of the United 
Nations: an agenda for further change (A/57/387 and Corr.1) highlighted the 
fundamental role of ICT in the ongoing implementation of the reform process. The 
increasing reliance on ICT systems calls for a strategic and operational effort to 
ensure the security and continuity of these valued resources. The Secretary-
General’s report on the information and communications technology strategy 
(A/57/620) identifies several initiatives for addressing security policy and the 
technologies required to implement protection measures. The strategy also 
highlights the challenges to the Organization: As the Organization becomes 
increasingly interconnected electronically, both internally and within the United 
Nations system, as well as with civil society, it will be pushed to create a layered 
protection structure that is increasingly sophisticated, one that meets the demands of 
tens of thousands of users, while making sure that these resources remain available 
when needed.  
 
 

 A. Focus of the plan 
 
 

28. The focus of the project is directed towards protection measures for mission-
critical ICT services. The following ICT assets are deemed mission-critical and are 
therefore the focus of the proposal: 

 • Systems that are deemed essential to enabling basic administrative functions, 
inter alia, personnel administration, payroll, recruitment, accounts payable, 



 A/62/477
 

13 07-53440 
 

procurement, treasury and disbursement, budget formulation and allocation, 
procurement, insurance and travel. At present these services are mainly being 
addressed by the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), which 
will be replaced by the enterprise resource planning system. 

 • Electronic communication systems: electronic mail and the associated Internet 
infrastructure.  

 • Data repositories: data produced by and under custodianship of the United 
Nations, representing information and knowledge critical to the mission of the 
Organization. The enterprise content management system will replace many 
existing systems such as the Official Document System of the United Nations 
(ODS), United Nations websites and other decentralized repositories. 

 
 

 B. Approach to implementation 
 
 

29. The framework to be put in place will address two objectives: business 
continuity and disaster recovery. Business continuity encompasses the computing 
and telecommunication facilities that will be required to restart critical operations, 
following a significant disruptive episode, so as to ensure continuance of ICT 
services. Disaster recovery addresses the preventive and operational actions required 
to preserve critical business software applications and data in order to minimize 
losses in the event of a significant disruptive episode.  

30. Most of the duty stations have acquired some protection for scenarios one and 
two. Annex I examines the deficiencies and the proposed remedies for all the duty 
stations included in the organizational scope of this project (United Nations 
Headquarters in New York, the United Nations Offices at Geneva, Vienna and 
Nairobi, the regional commissions, the International Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International 
Court of Justice). There is an ongoing effort by all these duty stations to close the 
identified gaps. The United Nations Office at Geneva is working with the 
International Computing Centre to build more backup and redundancy for its local 
systems. Similar projects are being carried out in the Economic Commission for 
Africa (ECA) and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) 
with the construction of secondary data centres for the most critical systems. The 
proposal in this report is mainly focused on providing capability to sustain scenarios 
three and four with the goal of ensuring a recovery point objective of 24 hours for 
critical services while preparing the required infrastructure for enterprise 
applications.  

31. Two disaster recovery sites have been selected to sustain this strategy: the 
United Nations Logistics Base and the proposed site B. By design, these facilities 
are situated geographically so as to ensure the visibility of all satellites currently 
utilized by the United Nations. Both sites would host the computing and data 
storage equipment capable of operating the ICT services that have been deemed 
critical to supporting business continuity operations. The United Nations Logistics 
Base and site B will form the basis for scenarios three and four disaster recovery 
and business continuity support for United Nations Headquarters and the offices 
away from Headquarters, which is the equivalent of the tier 3 approach for peace 
operations detailed in paragraphs 46-50 below.  



A/62/477  
 

07-53440 14 
 

32. Both centralized data centre sites (Brindisi and site B) will mirror one another 
in terms of data and will host computing and data storage equipment. These could 
be accessed remotely from any of the duty stations covered by the plan to operate 
critical enterprise applications. This set-up will provide both disaster recovery and 
business continuity for any critical enterprise applications hosted in this 
environment.  

33. In addition, site B could serve as a disaster recovery site for all critical 
departmental applications used by the duty stations within the scope of this project. 
A detailed list, by duty station, of the applications that could benefit from this 
capability is provided in annex I. As part of this proposal, a recurrent amount is 
being requested so as to maintain the necessary communications from the offices 
away from Headquarters and the Tribunals to site B. 

34. Both sites must be adequately supplied with infrastructure to support their 
roles. Equally, other duty stations must build and maintain an appropriate capability 
in order to make use of these facilities. While they are an essential part of the 
disaster recovery and business continuity capability, these infrastructure assets 
would not only be in constant use so as to ensure disaster recovery, if needed, but 
also enhance the quality of several existing services that relied on storage and 
telecommunication links. 
 
 

 C. Integration with previously funded ICT disaster recovery and 
business continuity and security projects 
 
 

35. In formulating the initial proposals for the disaster recovery and business 
continuity system, global standards have been adopted for technologies, equipment 
and design to leverage economies of scale, bring down maintenance costs, improve 
maintainability and build a common pool of skills.  

36. A synopsis of previously funded projects with which the ICT disaster recovery 
and business continuity system would be fully integrated is presented in annex II. 
The integration of the proposed project with these previous activities will provide a 
fully functional ICT disaster recovery and business continuity system for the United 
Nations Secretariat.  
 
 

 V. Disaster recovery and business continuity in field operations 
 
 

 A. Disaster recovery and business continuity: a three-tiered approach 
 
 

37. The disaster recovery and business continuity infrastructure for global field 
operations is based on a complementary scalable, three-tiered architecture designed 
to mitigate varying degrees of risk associated with field operations. The approach 
comprises on-site distributed data centres (tier 1); an off-site operational facility 
located in the mission’s theatre of operations in selected missions in cases where 
security assessments warrant (tier 2); and out-of-theatre data backup in the United 
Nations Logistics Base (tier 3). This three-tiered structure ensures that disaster 
recovery and business continuity solutions are proportional to the event causing the 
disruption. For example, in the absence of a distributed data centre (tier 1), all 
mission staff would have to relocate to an off-site location in the event of a small, 



 A/62/477
 

15 07-53440 
 

localized disruption to the operation of one data centre. Paragraphs 38-50 below 
detail the concept of operations for the three-tiered approach to disaster recovery 
and business continuity for field operations. Owing to their operating environments, 
most offices away from Headquarters and United Nations Headquarters do not 
require in-theatre, off-site disaster recovery and business continuity capability 
(tier 2), as explained below. This approach calls for the relocation of staff to a 
nearby secure facility to maintain local activities. This three-tiered approach is 
therefore specific to field missions. United Nations Headquarters, offices away from 
Headquarters and Tribunals require only the equivalent of tier 1 and tier 3 support.  
 
 

 B. Tier 1: In-mission, on-site (distributed data centres) 
 
 

38. Purpose. At the mission headquarters, all mission data are stored in data 
centres (often referred to as “server rooms”). In the absence of distributed data 
centres, the partial or complete loss of the data centre would seriously impact the 
mission’s ability to continue daily operations. To mitigate this risk, a second, fully 
operational data centre that mirrors the capability, applications and data of the 
primary centre is established, with users evenly distributed among the centres. Thus, 
if one data centre fails, users will continue to have access to the mission’s core 
information and applications with minimal or no disruptions of day-to-day 
operations. The objective is to ensure resilience in the provision of information 
technology services by facilitating continuous access to the mission’s data and 
applications.  

39. Supporting technologies. Software applications, up-to-date data files, and 
folder structures are hosted and accessed at each facility. This set-up is facilitated 
through various technologies such as mesh networking, clustering, load balancing 
and mirroring. High-availability clusters are groups of servers that are 
interconnected, thus improving the availability of services to the user. Load 
balancing operates by routing network traffic through clustered front-end servers 
that will distribute the traffic to a collection of back-end servers, thereby balancing 
the load on each server. Although implemented primarily for improved performance, 
this configuration also facilitates high availability. 

40. Illustrative example. The data centres in Kinshasa (United Nations 
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)) are 
located in the main mission headquarters and the mission logistics base. During 
periods of civil unrest or backup generator failure during power outages, the main 
headquarters building located in the centre of Kinshasa becomes inaccessible for 
extended periods. During these periods, all mission data become inaccessible to the 
entire mission user community. Additionally, it is at these critical periods that staff 
safety and security are most at risk, while all important, accurate, relevant and 
timely information is inaccessible. With the introduction of the distributed data 
centre model, the load (data transmission) is distributed between the mission 
headquarters and the mission logistics base. Thus, all users can continue ICT 
operations when one of the sites is compromised, as communications will be 
seamlessly redirected to the operational site, greatly mitigating the risk to the 
operational integrity of the mission. 



A/62/477  
 

07-53440 16 
 

 C. Tier 2: In-theatre, off-site (geographically redundant facility) 
 
 

41. Purpose: In-theatre, off-site facilities are required in missions that are located 
in regions where the potential for civil unrest, military activity or natural disaster 
requiring the evacuation of staff is considered to be high. To provide this level of 
redundancy, an in-theatre, off-site facility would be established to ensure that a 
secure operating environment is available in the event of an incident requiring 
evacuation of mission personnel. During these periods, key staff would be relocated 
to this standby facility located outside the area affected by the disturbance. This 
standby facility would normally be located in a nearby country or State.  

42. Supporting technologies. Data replication technologies are used to 
synchronize data between the primary and secondary facilities on a regular basis. 
Replication refers to the use of software and hardware resources to synchronize 
data.  

43. Illustrative example. The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in 
Kosovo (UNMIK) has established an in-theatre, off-site facility in Skopje. In the 
event of widespread civil unrest in Priština, where the mission headquarters is 
located, key staff will be relocated to Skopje and will be able to resume critical 
operations within a short period.  

44. In the recent past, the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (ONUCI) has 
had to evacuate staff during various periods of unrest. During these evacuations to 
declared safe havens in Ghana and the Gambia, mission personnel were isolated 
from their work owing to a lack of access to critical business information and 
applications in the absence of an off-site facility. While a limited capacity 
communications network, entailing primarily voice and facsimile communications, 
was provided to evacuated personnel, no access to mission data or applications 
could be provided. The availability of an in-theatre, off-site facility would have 
ensured that key staff could continue essential operations.  

45. A shared facility is the most cost-effective solution for missions located in the 
same geographical region. Each mission would share the costs associated with the 
establishment, maintenance and staffing of one off-site data centre. For example, 
most of the missions in the Middle Eastern region could locate their tier 2 site in 
Cyprus. The Department of Field Support is actively seeking such cost-saving 
opportunities. 

 
 

 D. Tier 3: Out-of-theatre, off-site (United Nations Logistics Base  
at Brindisi, Italy) 
 
 

46. Purpose. Tier 3 calls for the backup of mission data in the United Nations 
Logistics Base and the provision of ICT infrastructure that will enable a limited 
number of key personnel to continue operations at the United Nations Logistics 
Base in the event of an occurrence that requires evacuation of all staff from the 
mission, where no tier 2 facility is available or where the entire theatre of operations 
is compromised. 

47. The United Nations Logistics Base serves as the hub for all common ICT 
services and as a data repository for the critical data of field missions. It is peace 
operations’ designated out-of-theatre, off-site standby facility for mission staff in the 



 A/62/477
 

17 07-53440 
 

event of an out-of-theatre evacuation. The United Nations Logistics Base facilitates 
business continuity by providing access to telecommunications provided both 
commercially and by the United Nations, enterprise applications and mission data 
and information systems. Access would be granted to e-mail, Internet, corporate 
data files and centralized applications hosted in the United Nations Logistics Base 
such as the Mercury procurement system and the Galileo inventory management 
system. On arrival in the United Nations Logistics Base, evacuated personnel would 
be provided with immediate access to ICT resources and could continue critical 
operations. In addition, all electronic transactions that had been processed in the 
United Nations Logistics Base would be immediately available to personnel upon 
resumption of duties in their duty station. 

48. Supporting technologies. Replication technologies, similar in this regard to 
the tier 2 methodology, are used to transfer files and databases to out-of-theatre 
servers in the United Nations Logistics Base. The data are then used for offline 
backup protection, disaster recovery and data mining. These replication and file 
transfer technologies move multiple files efficiently, irrespective of their size. They 
also have the ability to transmit only parts of a file that have been changed, thereby 
reducing transmission time and bandwidth utilization, and thus increasing efficiency 
in the various communications links. Whenever possible, data transfers are 
scheduled to take place during nights and weekends when satellite links are less 
utilized. In a multi-tiered configuration, the latest and/or most critical files and 
databases are stored in real-time, fast-access storage platforms, while older and less 
critical files are stored utilizing more cost-effective and economically viable storage 
systems.  

49. Illustrative example. During the second Gulf war in 2003, a number of 
personnel were evacuated to the United Nations Logistics Base from the United 
Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM). These personnel were 
provided access to ICT resources and were able to continue limited operations, as 
access to critical data was available through centralized applications. Mission data 
from UNIKOM distributed systems were also available as they transported the data 
using storage devices, a process that would not be required today as all mission data 
are backed up in the United Nations Logistics Base. 

50. The three-tier strategy outlined above will provide missions with the capacity 
to continue limited operations in cases of localized or regional disruptions. A 
comprehensive list of all field missions and their current disaster recovery and 
business continuity arrangements is contained in annex III. However, given 
increased dependence of the Department of Field Support and the Secretariat on the 
central communications hub in the United Nations Logistics Base, the Department 
of Field Support is currently seeking a secondary active communications facility 
that will provide fail-over in case of a disruption to the ICT infrastructure of the 
United Nations Logistics Base. Section VI below examines the necessity of having a 
secondary active communications facility and provides an update on the steps that 
have been taken to date towards sourcing the facility. 
 
 



A/62/477  
 

07-53440 18 
 

 VI. The secondary active communications facility 
 
 

 A. Identification of need 
 
 

51. The Information Technology Services Division and the Department of Field 
Support have identified the need for a secondary active communications facility that 
will be used to complement the United Nations Logistics Base and to host 
Secretariat enterprise system solutions as part of the three-tiered global disaster 
recovery and business continuity framework.  

52. The development of a centralized hub for telecommunications, centralized 
applications, a central data repository and a global help desk in the United Nations 
Logistics Base satisfies an important and ever-increasing requirement for efficient 
and cost-effective ICT services for United Nations peace operations. In the current 
operational environment, it would be impossible to start new United Nations peace 
operations without the ICT centralized support services offered through the United 
Nations Logistics Base, such as the Internet, the provision of essential corporate 
information systems, long-distance calling, e-mail, voice over Internet Protocol, 
web mail, application support and a global help desk. 

53. Limiting Department of Field Support operations to a single site, although 
benefiting from economies of scale and gained efficiencies, presents an enormous 
risk of compromising missions’ core functions owing to the dependence on a single 
point for ICT operations. While all field missions avail themselves of backup and 
disaster recovery services from the United Nations Logistics Base, the 
telecommunications hub and centralized applications (Galileo, Mercury, etc.) hosted 
there do not have a remote backup facility. Thus, the entire Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations/Department of Field Support ICT network relies on a 
telecommunications hub that has no “alternative” in case of a major outage. An 
outage in Brindisi would have a catastrophic impact on all field missions’ global 
operations: field missions would lose much of their voice communications, in 
particular inter-mission communications and international telephone access; all 
missions would lose access to the Intranet and e-mail; most missions would lose 
access to the Internet; and access to essential centralized information systems would 
be unavailable. This vulnerability has been highlighted by the Office of Internal 
Oversight Services (OIOS) in its recent management audit of the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations. 

54. A secondary active site with full capabilities must be established to ensure the 
continuity and integrity of the core functions of the Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations/Department of Field Support in the event of a catastrophic incident and 
to provide continuous voice, data and video services in cases of short-term 
disruptions. The Department of Field Support is currently seeking such a facility, 
one that will meet its requirements for a secondary active site and will also meet the 
requirements for hosting the Secretariat systems. 
 
 

 B. Concept of operations 
 
 

55. The term “secondary active” describes the core approach taken in establishing 
the facility. Both the primary and secondary sites will be considered “live” 
operational hubs, as the workload will be distributed to both sites simultaneously. 



 A/62/477
 

19 07-53440 
 

Neither facility will be on standby, awaiting a disaster, but will be continuously 
online (that is to say, each site will process approximately 50 per cent of the traffic). 
In the event of a disaster at one site, the remaining operational site will be required 
to absorb only 50 per cent. This configuration will ensure that in case of a major 
outage, only 50 per cent of operations would initially be compromised at any given 
time. The facilities are often referred to as “active/active” or “hot” sites in this type 
of configuration. Each facility has the capacity to absorb some or all of the work of 
the other for an extended period of time, thereby eliminating dependency on the 
availability and relocation of staff at any single location, and eliminating the risk 
associated with a single point of failure. The configuration supports maximum 
geographical separation and assures business continuity through actual use rather 
than through infrequent testing. Additionally, the utilization of least-cost routing 
technologies will facilitate usage of the best rates available for field missions’ 
external telecommunications traffic, thus providing continuous savings for the 
Organization. 

56. It is anticipated that site B will be utilized by all United Nations peace 
operations, United Nations Headquarters and offices away from Headquarters. As it 
is scalable, site B provides additional opportunities which could include utilization 
by United Nations organizations, funds and programmes. The facility will mirror the 
telecommunication infrastructure currently in place in the United Nations Logistics 
Base and will present an opportunity for significant improvements in equipment 
layout, integration and configuration.  

57. The secondary facility would also host the computing and data storage 
equipment capable of operating the Secretariat ICT services that have been deemed 
critical to supporting business continuity operations. The two sites (the United 
Nations Logistics Base and site B) will mirror one another in terms of data and 
could be accessed remotely from the business continuity sites to operate critical 
software applications of any of the Secretariat duty stations covered by the plan. 
 
 

 C. Facility sourcing process 
 
 

58. In respect of selecting a suitable facility, the first major consideration would 
be its location, as the facility requires the visibility of all satellites currently utilized 
by the United Nations. Long-term contractual arrangements have been established 
with the satellite providers and it is envisaged that these arrangements will be 
required for the foreseeable future. This requirement limits possible host countries 
to those located within the geographical convergence of the footprint of the 
satellites. 

59. It is also critical that site B be located at a safe distance from the current 
facility in the United Nations Logistics Base so as to ensure that both facilities are 
not compromised owing to any single event. This requires geographical separation 
and an independence from the current logistic, power and communications 
infrastructures in Brindisi. The objective is to minimize the risk that both a primary 
and a backup site, and their respective labour pools, could be impaired by a single 
wide-scale regional disruption. For example, a national power outage at one facility 
would not impact the second facility, as they would not share the same power grid. 

60. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations, in December 2005, had initially 
requested proposals to host site B from the 43 States Members of the United Nations 



A/62/477  
 

07-53440 20 
 

located within the satellite convergence area. In March 2006, prior to a final 
selection, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations requested the Internal 
Management Consulting Section (iMCS) of the Office of Internal Oversight 
Services (OIOS) to conduct a management review of the solicitation and selection 
process. The Internal Management Consulting Section concluded that it was unable 
to validate or endorse the process used by the Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations, as the review had uncovered several areas where the site selection 
process needed to be more systematic, consistent and transparent; and it 
recommended three possible courses of action. After carefully considering the 
alternatives, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations decided to proceed with 
the option to disqualify the selection process and start over with a more systematic 
and reliable method. 

61. With the active participation of the Internal Management Consulting Section in 
the preparatory stages, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations developed a 
refined process and method of soliciting, reviewing and evaluating proposed sites. 
In July 2006, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations resubmitted requests to 
all Member States within the predefined geographical area to submit new proposals 
to host the site. An information exchange session was conducted with Member 
States on 25 July 2006.  

62. A multidisciplinary working group was established to conduct an assessment 
of received proposals utilizing selection criteria and a scorecard methodology 
developed with the Internal Management Consulting Section during the initiation 
phase of the project. Four Member States, Finland, Romania, Serbia and Spain, 
submitted proposals. These proposals first had to meet certain prequalification 
criteria, regarding, for example, location within the convergence area, size, 
unobstructed view of the satellites and unrestricted access to the site for a minimum 
of 10 years. A rigorous process of assessment of the proposals that met these criteria 
was then performed. The scorecard methodology used to evaluate the proposals was 
based on a weighted scoring method summarized under three major groupings: 
technical factors, financial analysis, and other operational considerations. Technical 
factors included site considerations, power, communications infrastructure and 
safety and security. The financial analysis was based on the cost associated with 
establishing the facility. Operational considerations included the accessibility to 
housing, health services, ground transportation and shipping. 

63. Based on the predefined assessment criteria, the working group determined 
that the proposal for a site at Valencia submitted by the Government of Spain was 
technically compliant, met the geographical, logistic, power and communication 
separation requirements outlined in paragraphs 58 and 59 above, and offered the 
most advantageous terms for the Organization. The Department of Field Support is 
engaging in discussions with representatives of the Government of Spain in order to 
draft a host country agreement. The total three-year cost to the United Nations 
peacekeeping operations for establishing the facility, comprising equipment 
purchases, staffing and operational costs, is estimated at $9,817,450. It is envisaged 
that costs may be recovered for the usage of the facility by non-Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations/Department of Field Support entities, when it is fully 
operational, through standard charge-back mechanisms. In its proposal, the 
Government of Spain offered to assume all other costs, such as those for all 
construction related to establishing the facility. It is planned that the facility will be 
fully operational in 2010, if the project is initiated in the fiscal period 2007-2008. 



 A/62/477
 

21 07-53440 
 

64. The above estimate of $9,817,450 includes the establishment of one P-5 post 
required for management of the facility. Given its crucial role in global 
telecommunications for peacekeeping and the active relationship with the United 
Nations Logistics Base as outlined in paragraph 55, establishing and managing 
site B will be a complex undertaking and will require extensive knowledge and 
managerial expertise. The incumbent will be responsible for all ICT operational, 
managerial and administrative tasks associated with the set-up and daily operations 
of the facility, with administrative assistance to be provided by the United Nations 
Logistics Base. Duties will include: planning and design of the facility’s 
infrastructure in conjunction with the host Government; project management; 
supervision of staff within the facility; initiating the procurement of required 
equipment; installation of the equipment upon completion of the structures; day-to-
day management of the facility and its resources when established; and liaison with 
the host Government, the United Nations Logistics Base and United Nations 
Headquarters. 
 
 

 VII. Timetable for implementation 
 
 

 A. United Nations Headquarters and Offices away from Headquarters 
 
 

65. The time frame for the development and implementation of the proposed plan 
is approximately 18-24 months, contingent on procurement, delivery of goods and 
the availability of the required human resources, as detailed in section VIII below.  

66. The project plan is to be implemented concurrently for the United Nations 
Logistics Base and site B, as soon as it is made available by the Department of Field 
Support, and will be customized based on the unique requirements of each 
installation. Twelve months are indicated for the duration of all activities with a 
contingency of from 6 to 12 months to account for procurement, recruitment and 
facility readiness for each installation. 

67. The implementation plan will include procurement of goods and services and 
recruitment of human resources; as both these activities will need to be conducted 
frequently, they have the potential to significantly impact the final implementation. 

68. Based on lessons learned and the extensive research of the proposed project, 
several steps have already been taken to ensure a timely and risk-managed project 
schedule. These steps include: 

 • A global Secretariat-wide project management team 

 • Published expressions of interest and request for proposals 

 • A single source, systems-contract approach, wherever feasible 

 • Fully defined technical specifications and standards  

 • Establishment of the integration and interoperability of components  

69. Consultations with industry suggest that the estimate of 18-24 months is very 
realistic.

 B. Department of Field Support: site B 
 
 

70. As detailed in section V, the Department of Field Support is well advanced in 
the implementation of disaster recovery and business continuity for field missions. 
However, as outlined in section VI, a secondary active communications facility is 
required to eliminate the risk associated with a single point of failure that would 
exist based on dependence of field operations on the United Nations Logistics Base. 
It is expected that site B will be fully operational upon completion of the project.  
 
 

 VIII. Financing and managing the project 
 
 

 A. Resource requirements 
 
 

71. The disaster recovery and business continuity approach, based on cost-benefit 
analysis, balances operational requirements and cost-efficiency. The approach 
measured cost sensitivity to Recovery Time Objective/Recovery Point Objective 
benchmarks of less than 24 hours and greater than 24 hours. The analysis indicated 
nominal cost differences between 12 hours and 48 hours. However, a Recovery 
Time Objective/Recovery Point Objective of less than 12 hours was estimated to 
cost nearly twice the amount in the current proposal based on telecommunication 
and hardware costs. On the other hand, a Recovery Time Objective/Recovery Point 
Objective of 72 hours or more was estimated to cost approximately half the amount 
in the current proposal; however, the resulting detriment to the operations of the 
Organization was deemed to be significantly costly overall and therefore not 
acceptable. The present proposal for the implementation of an ICT disaster recovery 
and business continuity capability commensurate with the operational requirements 
of the Secretariat has been assessed to be the most cost-effective. 

72. Table 1 below summarizes all costs associated with the implementation of 
disaster recovery and business continuity in the United Nations Logistics Base and 
site B. These include all capital expenditures as well as projected recurring 
expenditures including telecommunications costs, maintenance costs and the costs 
for the human resources deemed necessary to install and operate the proposed 
infrastructure and the systems designed to support the plan.  

73. Project costs proposed to be financed from the regular budget in the biennium 
2008-2009 are estimated at $11,249,400 United States dollars. The three-year 
project cost for peacekeeping is $9,817,400, of which $298,700 is for the period 
1 July 2007-30 June 2008 and $9,518,700 for the period 1 July 2008-30 June 2010. 
The details of these costs are shown in the table below.

74. The amount requested under the regular budget encompasses the equipment, 
software and services required to implement replication and disaster recovery 
capabilities in both the United Nations Logistics Base and site B for the Secretariat 
and the offices away from Headquarters. It also includes a yearly recurrent amount 
of $2,338,500 requested in part for the maintenance cost of the equipment but, more 
importantly, to provide communications infrastructure and links between the offices 
away from Headquarters and site B serving as disaster recovery site for the most 
critical applications for offices away from Headquarters. Additional investments 
may be required by some of the offices away from Headquarters to bring their own 
systems up to the technical standard needed to operate in such an environment. 
Capital expenditure will also have to be incurred periodically on additional storage 
capacity so as to accommodate growth in volume of data to be stored.  

75. As outlined in section VI, the three-year cost under the peacekeeping budgets 
to establish site B is $9,817,450. This includes both post and non-post resources. 
The resource requirements for the period 1 July 2007-30 June 2008 for 
peacekeeping amount to $298,700. This includes the establishment of one P-5 post 
to manage the project and the facility and one General Service post to provide 
administrative support. Transportation and shipping costs are also included. 

76. As indicated in paragraph 20, the implementation of disaster recovery and 
business continuity across the Secretariat has been uneven at best. While the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations is well advanced in the implementation of 
disaster recovery and business continuity plans necessitated by its operational 
environment, the Secretariat and the offices away from Headquarters require 
investment to elevate the technical infrastructure. For that reason, the request for 
equipment, licences and contractual services is higher for the regular budget and this 
needs to commence in 2008.  



A/62/477  
 

07-53440 24 
 

77. The Secretariat and offices away from Headquarters project will be centrally 
managed by Headquarters under the direction of the Chief Information Technology 
Officer, who will be supported by the service offices at Headquarters (Information 
Technology Services Division/Communications and Information Technology 
Service) and within each respective duty station. To ensure a well-coordinated 
approach to project management, a small task force made up of staff from within the 
already existing resources of the Information Technology Services Division and the 
Communications and Information Technology Service has been established at 
Headquarters.  

78. Headquarters will oversee the central direction, management and coordination 
functions relating to project management and the activities undertaken by the 
project management team. Responsibilities carried out by the team will include: 
promotion of Secretariat-wide disaster recovery and business continuity system 
design standards; organization of forums, work groups and meetings to ensure a 
unified approach to the project; coordination and management of single-vendor 
contracts; facilitation of policy, procedure and guidance directives as determined by 
the global working group; assuring Secretariat-wide interoperability of relevant 
technologies; and minimization of redundancy of effort in producing work products 
such as high-level business cases, requests for proposals, and training materials. 
 
 

 B. Human resources requirements 
 
 

79. The management and operation of a global operational framework for ICT 
disaster recovery and business continuity require a small cadre of dedicated staff 
and contractual services. The establishment of two Senior Disaster 
Recovery/Business Continuity Officer posts under the regular budget is critical to 
the achievement of the proposal. The United Nations Logistics Base and site B will 
need the additional staffing (one P-5 staff member at each location) with specialized 
skills to deal with the implementation and management of the disaster recovery and 
business continuity strategy. The services provided will be for the United Nations 
Secretariat as a whole. In their capacity as global disaster recovery sites, the United 
Nations Logistics Base and site B will, additionally, require contractual services to 
support the maintenance of servers that have to run the various mission-critical 
applications. 

80. As outlined in section VI and paragraph 75 above, site B will be fully 
established over a three-year period. Under the support account for peacekeeping 
operations, one P-5 staff member and one General Service staff member are required 
in Phase I of the project. The P-5 staff member will be responsible for the 
establishment and commissioning of site B, including the planning, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation of all site B project activities. The General Service staff 
member will provide administrative support for the project. The approved posts will 
be supported within existing resources in the support account for the period ending 
30 June 2008 and proposed for inclusion as additional posts in the context of the 
support account budget for 1 July 2008-30 June 2009. Additional posts will be 
required for phases II and III to provide management and operational support as the 
facility is being established as a global ICT hub and will be proposed under future 
support account budgets.  



 A/62/477

81. The Department of Field Support requires one P-5 staff member to provide 
managerial oversight for the disaster recovery and business continuity services in 
field missions. The incumbent will coordinate all disaster recovery and business 
continuity activities in field missions from United Nations Headquarters. The 
incumbent will act as the Department of Field Support disaster recovery and 
business continuity focal point, provide central direction on the Department of Field 
Support-disaster recovery and business continuity activities and develop, maintain 
and implement policies, procedures and systems for the particular needs of disaster 
recovery and business continuity in field missions. Table 2 below shows the 
distribution of posts between the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget.

 C. Opportunities for return on investment 
 
 

82. An investment in disaster recovery and business continuity capability is not 
limited in value to its single purpose, but offers numerous opportunities for 
significant return on investment. The system is not employed only in instances of 
response: it is a continuous-use system offering substantial performance and 
capacity increases for day-to-day operations. With the proposed system in place, the 
rationale behind providing processing autonomy for the Internal Management 
Information Section, enterprise resource planning and other enterprise applications 
to all duty stations and resulting operation of multiple installations begins to 



A/62/477  
 

07-53440 26 
 

weaken. The consolidation of some resource-intensive administrative activities 
becomes highly feasible. Such consolidation could generate significant savings to 
the Organization and, if implemented, will provide impetus for reviewing major 
administrative functions with significant potential for increased efficiency. Efforts 
are under way to assess this potential to foster full use of ICT as an enabler of 
efficiency throughout the Organization so that returns on investments can be 
realized. 
 
 

 IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
 
 

 A. Regular budget 
 
 

83. Based on the results of extensive analysis, this report contains a proposal for 
an implementation commensurate with the demands of the operating requirements 
of the Organization, while remaining fully cognizant of the ever-present threats to 
ICT services. The Secretary-General is firmly committed to pursuing this key 
element of his proposals for secure and reliable mission-critical ICT services 
supporting the Organization’s mission. The implementation of these proposals 
would give rise to additional activities and resource requirements of $11,185,600 
under Section 28D, Office of Central Support Services, of the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 2008-2009 (A/62/6 (Sect. 28D)) and $63,800 under section 
35, Staff assessment, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 
2008-2009 (A/62/6 (Sect. 35)), to be offset by an equivalent amount under income 
section 1, Income from staff assessment, of the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009 (A/62/6 (Income sect. 1)). The proposal would require the 
establishment of two posts at the P-5 level under the regular budget as well as the 
major requirements of $3,123,800 for contractual services, $3,674,400 for general 
operating expenses, and $3,811,000 for equipment, as per paragraph 73.  
 
 

 B. Peacekeeping 
 
 

84. A secondary active site with full capabilities is required to ensure the 
continuity and integrity of the core functions of field missions in the event of a 
catastrophic incident and to provide continuous voice, data and video services in 
cases of short-term disruptions. The creation of a secondary site at Valencia would 
enable the Department of Field Support to meet the requirements of continuity in 
services to missions.  

85. The total three-year cost to the United Nations peacekeeping operations for 
establishing the facility, consisting of equipment purchases, staffing and operational 
costs, is estimated at $9,817,400. The resource requirements for the period 1 July 
2007-30 June 2008 is $298,700 and includes the establishment of one P-5 post and 
one General Service temporary position, $64,000 for travel of staff and $122,600 for 
general operating expenses, as detailed in paragraph 73.  

86. Approval is needed for one post at the P-5 level under the Department of Field 
Support to provide managerial oversight for the disaster recovery and business 
continuity services in field missions, as described in paragraph 81. The position will 
be supported within existing resources of the support account for the period ending 



 A/62/477
 

27 07-53440 
 

30 June 2008 and will be proposed for inclusion as an additional post in the 
proposed budget for the support account for the period 1 July 2008-30 June 2009.  

 
 

  Part two 
  United Nations Headquarters disaster recovery and business 
  continuity capability 

 
 

 I. Introduction 
 
 

87. The increase of critical departmental applications with high-availability 
requirements coupled with the imminent implementation of the capital master plan 
provides impetus to enhancing current United Nations Headquarters disaster 
recovery and business continuity capabilities. The present report explains the 
current condition of the United Nations Headquarters data centres, and the impact of 
the transition under the capital master plan, and elaborates on a proposal for 
ensuring the continuity of ICT services for scenarios one and two as detailed in part 
one, section III. The intended results of the proposal are the design and 
implementation of a disaster recovery and business continuity infrastructure 
sufficiently capable of addressing risks and meeting the United Nations 
Headquarters ICT service demands of the future. 

88. The current ICT facilities that provide data centre service include: 

 • The Secretariat PABX centre: a 2,000 square foot telecommunications facility 
established in the Secretariat building in the 1980s. This facility provides 
telephonic services to all Secretariat area buildings. 

 • The Secretariat data centre: a 5,000 square foot data centre established in the 
Secretariat building in the 1980s currently providing computing, storage, 
network and related infrastructure services to all Secretariat buildings. 

 • The Basement extension: a 1,000 square foot facility established in 2000 to 
augment the Secretariat data centre as a result of space limitations. 

 • The Security Command Centre: a 1,000 square foot facility built in 2006 
providing computers, storage and network infrastructure for the physical 
security system. 

 • The Manhattan Development Corporation 2 (DC2) Secondary Data Centre: a 
3,000 square foot facility built in the 1980s to provide disaster recovery and 
business continuity capability to the Secretariat data centre. 

89. The proposal in part two presents an opportunity to improve upon and 
consolidate these five ICT facilities into two facilities, a North Lawn data centre and 
a data centre in Long Island City, while providing the necessary additional space 
needed for actual disaster recovery and business continuity capability. This approach 
is necessary to mitigate the increased risk exposure for United Nations Headquarters 
but also offers numerous advantages which, on the basis of cost-benefit analysis and 
risk assessment, present the most advantageous business case for achieving disaster 
recovery and business continuity objectives. 

90. As indicated in part one, the proposed site B would serve United Nations 
Headquarters for scenarios three and four and maintain high availability for major 



A/62/477  
 

07-53440 28 
 

enterprise applications such as enterprise resource planning, customer relationship 
management and enterprise content management. The proposals of parts one and 
two of this report are therefore complementary. 
 
 

 II. Risk exposure 
 
 

91. The initial 3,000 square feet allocated for disaster recovery and business 
continuity in DC2 are not sufficient to sustain the systems’ backup needs for local 
applications. It also does not allow any leverage for building additional redundancy 
for the most critical local applications in order to limit business interruptions. 
Analyses have shown that if the Information Technology Services Division does not 
improve and expand the area, United Nations Headquarters will not be able to 
prevent loss of data and increasing downtime may result. 

92. In addition, the relocation of data centre facilities currently located in the main 
Secretariat building under the capital master plan would require the DC2 facility to 
operate as the primary data centre. This was not its intended use and consequently 
the facility does not have sufficient capacity to absorb these significantly increased 
demands. Specifically, the current power and cooling systems are obsolete, there is 
no emergency power, the space cannot accommodate the required expansion, and 
the facility does not have a secondary satellite dish. While the facility provided 
sufficient capacity for the purposes originally intended, its proximity to the 
Secretariat building and its sharing of power and communications systems do not 
present the ideal conditions for an enterprise-class disaster recovery and business 
continuity facility. These risks and the current potential opportunities provide 
impetus for proposing an alternative strategy aimed at optimizing investment and 
providing greater value and security to the Organization. 

93. Risk exposure emerging from years of growth and the capital master plan 
project suggest a call for change. Both data centres are located in spaces not 
intended to accommodate computer room functions and infrastructure. Furthermore, 
all spare electrical and cooling capacity has been exhausted as a result of expansion 
since the 1980s designed to meet growing demand. Under current conditions, there 
is no capacity for growth or scalability to meet future requirements. Moreover, the 
facilities are showing their age and fallibility along with limited fire suppression 
capability and poor air flow and cooling, which often result in overheating of 
critical hardware systems.  

94. The current secondary data centre in DC2 has no emergency generator backup, 
and is located within one city block of the primary data centre in the Secretariat 
building. These factors render the facility inappropriate as a backup site for mission-
critical enterprise applications and for business continuity and disaster recovery 
purposes. In light of these deficiencies, the Board of Auditors recently noted that the 
current arrangement was unsustainable through 2008, and recommended relocation 
of the secondary data centre to a more appropriate site. Clearly, this is a critical 
problem which the Secretariat must address without delay. 
 
 



 A/62/477
 

29 07-53440 
 

 III. Rationale 
 
 

95. The capital master plan project poses a high risk to the continuity of ICT 
infrastructure. In the context of this increased risk, information on the establishment 
of a North Lawn data centre and an alternative data centre facility so as to preserve 
United Nations Headquarters capability for disaster recovery and business 
continuity is presented in the following sections. The Secretariat’s proposal for 
addressing these risks offers numerous long-term advantages and presents the 
Secretariat with a unique opportunity to upgrade and consolidate facilities and with 
the possibility of establishing multi-agency joint operations. 

96. A Long Island City data centre has been proposed to replace the secondary 
data centre in DC2. The four other facilities will be consolidated in the North Lawn 
data centre. The Organization is currently considering several sites in Long Island 
City which could accommodate up to approximately 300 staff and the data centre. 
The establishment of a location in Long Island City as a replacement for DC2 would 
enable the Secretariat to take advantage of its geographical, physical, and technical 
superiority as a disaster recovery and business continuity facility for United Nations 
Headquarters. 
 
 

 IV. Business case 
 
 

97. Amid the urgent requirement to increase the size of the United Nations 
Headquarters secondary data centre and mitigate risks incurred under the capital 
master plan transition, the Long Island City data centre proposal nevertheless 
presents a business case with extra benefits that include the consolidation of data 
centres; access to a lower-rent area along with the freeing up of existing space for 
United Nations business needs; cooperative arrangements with New York City-
based funds and programmes; and improvements to tier 1 disaster recovery and 
business continuity capability and scalability. 

98. Continuity under the capital master plan. The transition under the capital 
master plan will require the relocation of the 19th and 20th floor data centres and 
staff to a new facility in the current underground North Lawn printing plant 
building, thus taking advantage of space made available consequent to a reduction 
in the need to store paper documents, whose number will continue to shrink over the 
coming years. However, transitions of this nature are always extremely challenging 
and should not be initiated until an adequate secondary data centre is in place. The 
Information Technology Services Division proposes to establish a secondary data 
centre outside of midtown Manhattan as soon as possible, which would thus allow 
the space on the 11th floor of DC2 to revert to its former use as office space.  

99. Relocation of Information Technology Services Division staff. There will be 
a need for additional space for 5 new staff (3 under the regular budget and 
2 extrabudgetary) and approximately 36 contractors for whom resources have been 
proposed under section 28D, Office of Central Support Services, of the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 (A/62/6 (Sect. 28D)). These staff 
and contractors will work on operational matters or major projects within the 
Information Technology Services Division. Owing in part to unexpected 
procurement delays but also because of space constraints within the Secretariat 
complex, the Information Technology Services Division has been unable to move 



A/62/477  
 

07-53440 30 
 

forward as quickly as anticipated on a number of critical projects. The allocation of 
additional space would resolve this issue.  

100. Strengthening organizational capabilities. The move of additional 
Information Technology Services Division staff to Long Island City will strengthen 
the organizational capabilities needed for the ICT reform and the implementation of 
enterprise systems. Only end-user support staff and required management would 
need to stay in the Secretariat building, while all other ICT resources would work 
together out of the same location. As the Information Technology Services Division 
is facing many challenging projects, this geographical proximity will help create 
more synergy, avoid redundancy and improve communication and efficiency. This 
also offers the possibility to freeing up space in the Secretariat building for other 
United Nations needs even after the capital master plan project is over, while 
providing accommodation for staff at less cost than in Manhattan.  

 
 

 V. Opportunity for joint operations 
 
 

101. The Information Technology Services Division will require a reliable 
secondary data centre online before the start of the renovation of the Secretariat 
building. In fact, this is an urgent situation today. It is understood that the United 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), 
the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) have similar problems regarding their secondary data centres. 
The Information Technology Services Division has approached these organizations 
and all have expressed an interest in exploring the possibility of sharing a 
consolidated data centre in Long Island City and sharing costs. The Secretariat sees 
this as a unique opportunity to work with other organizations located in New York 
and to reduce long-term costs across the United Nations system while increasing 
efficiency. 

102. Recent discussions with UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA and the United Nations Joint 
Staff Pension Fund suggest new opportunities for providing a common service data 
centre. With the approval of the Long Island City facility, the possible cooperative 
arrangements, which would include a multi-agency joint operation, may be realized. 

103. The new data centre in Long Island City is planned to provide space 
availability of 12,000 square feet. Only half of that space is needed by the 
Information Technology Services Division for its actual operations; the other half 
would be made available to the other organizations, with the advantage for all 
parties of sharing the fit-out and maintenance cost and benefiting from economies of 
scale. The Information Technology Services Division will also continue to host part 
of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations/Department of Field Support 
operations which represent 20 per cent of its actual data centre activities. Since only 
6,000 square feet of the new 12,000 square foot data centre will be used for 
Information Technology Services Division operations, the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations/Department of Field Support will be given the equivalent 
of 1,200 square feet which represents 10 per cent of the physical space of the new 
data centre. In this regard, 10 per cent of the fit-out, rental and maintenance cost 
will be covered by the support account. 
 
 



 A/62/477
 

31 07-53440 
 

 VI. Cost-benefit analysis 
 
 

104. The establishment of a Long Island City data centre was assessed on the basis 
of a comparative cost-benefit analysis that weighed the options of renovating the 
existing DC2 facility, seeking alternate New York City-based options, and having 
operations migrate to a Long Island City data centre. The proposed strategy would 
enable the consolidation of five existing ICT facilities into two (see para. 88). The 
two facilities would be geographically separate so as to provide independent power 
and communication grids, and significantly improved environmental controls such 
as fire suppression, cooling and emergency power. However, it is also important that 
they be close enough together to allow technical and support personnel to travel 
between them quickly and efficiently. The benefits to be derived from the selection 
of Long Island City are numerous and include dual points of entry for 
communications; a power and communication grid different from that of the 
Secretariat; reduction of current lease rates to nearly half those of Manhattan; and 
scalability to expand as storage and service requirements grow. 
 
 

 VII. Human resources requirements 
 
 

105. The proposed establishment of a Long Island City data centre will require 
capital investment for fit-out and installation of equipment. This report identifies 
requirements necessary in order for the site to operate as a disaster recovery and 
business continuity facility, including hardware, software, services, communications 
and staff. Resource requirements include dedicated staff to ensure that the 
implementation proceeds without delay or disruption. The staff requirements 
include: three temporary migration managers at the P-3 level to be funded from 
general temporary assistance to manage the migration of both the DC2 data centre to 
the Long Island City data centre and the S19, S20, 2B91 and C110 data centres to 
the North Lawn data centre. These migration managers would start working in 
January 2009 to allow for from five to six months of planning before the start of the 
migration in May 2009. 
 
 

 VIII. Timetable for implementation 
 
 

106. The time frame for the development and implementation of the proposed plan 
is synchronized with the capital master plan schedule and is contingent on the 
availability of the required human resources discussed in section VII. The 
anticipated implementation schedule is as follows: 

 • The latest capital master plan schedule projects construction of the Long 
Island City data centre to begin in the first quarter of 2008 and to be completed 
in May 2009, following approval of funding 

 • After the finalization of the Long Island City data centre construction, from 
three to six months will be needed for migration from DC2 to Long Island City 

 • A similar timing will be followed for the North Lawn data centre, with a delay 
of six months, meaning a starting date in the third quarter of 2008 and the 
completion of the project at the beginning of 2010 

 
 



A/62/477

 IX. Financing and managing the project 
 
 

107. The costs for implementing the two data centres can be divided into two 
categories: (a) construction, fit-out and lease; and (b) equipment, contractual 
services and human resources. 

108. Construction, fit-out and lease of the data centres. The construction and fit-
out of the North Lawn data centre have been included as part of the capital master 
plan project; there are no lease costs, as the centre will be on the United Nations 
campus. The construction, fit-out and lease for a proposed secondary data centre in 
Long Island City and the accommodation of the 41 additional staff/contractors will 
require funding from the regular budget. The estimated requirements are based on 
the market rate and industry averages for rental of potential buildings in Long Island 
City and the construction costs. The estimated total for the fit-out of both the office 
space and data centre and the rent for the first two years is $20,879,200, as 
presented in table 3 below. Ten per cent of the fit-out and rental of the data centre 
only will be funded by the peacekeeping budget for its portion of the infrastructure 
managed by the Information Technology Services Division.

 Total 18 972 000 389 100 1 518 100 20 879 200 
 

 a It is estimated that in the first six months the main costs will be design fees and therefore 
only 20 per cent of the peacekeeping contribution to the construction will be required in the 
period 2007-2008. 

 b Including the peacekeeping share for the period July-December 2009 so that the total costs 
can be demonstrated for the two-year period 2008-2009. 

 
 

109. The major cost is the construction of the data centre which is estimated at 
$1,000 per square feet, or $12 million for the 12,000 square foot data centre. The 
construction will include raising floors, the power supply and the air conditioning 
necessary for a data centre. Another major cost will be for the addition of an 
emergency generator, which will cost $4 million and provide backup electricity in 
case of an outage to the local supply. Other costs include the office construction, the 
installation of security systems and access control systems, and design fees. 



 A/62/477
 

33 07-53440 
 

Recurrent cost for rent and utilities for the data centre will amount to $781,600 on a 
yearly basis from which 10 per cent, or $78,200, will be funded through the support 
account. 

110. It is noted that, while the costs presented in this report represent the total costs 
arising from the construction of a 12,000 square foot data centre, it is expected that 
there will be an element of cost-sharing between the United Nations and other 
organizations within the United Nations system, as per paragraphs 101-103 above. 
The net amount expected to be financed from the other organizations for the 
biennium 2008-2009 will be dependent on the final outcome of the negotiations with 
them that are currently under way. It is expected that as deliberations continue as 
regards the proposals of the Secretary-General on disaster recovery and business 
continuity, additional information will become available. 

111. The Secretariat is proposing to share costs on a square-foot basis. Based on the 
figure for the total square feet reported in paragraph 110 above, estimated cost-
sharing percentages on square feet would be the following: 

 • United Nations Headquarters: 40 per cent 

 • Department of Peacekeeping Operations/Department of Field Support: 
10 per cent 

 • Other funds and programmes: 50 per cent 

112. The capital master plan will be responsible for undertaking the design 
necessary in order for the swing space to include both the Information Technology 
Services Division data centre and staff, with costs borne through this proposal. 

113. Equipment, contractual services and human resources. Table 4 below 
summarizes the costs associated with the establishment of the new first (North 
Lawn) and secondary (Long Island City) data centres. These include all capital 
expenditures as well as projected recurring expenditures including 
telecommunications, maintenance costs and the human resources deemed necessary 
to install and operate the proposed infrastructure and systems so as to support the 
plan. As 20 per cent of the actual activities are related to the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations/Department of Field Support, the same proportion of the 
cost will be funded by the peacekeeping budget for the acquisition and installation 
of equipment in both data centres. The total requirements for the equipment, 
contractual services and human resources needed to establish the two data centres 
amount to $21,339,300. The requirements for the proposed Long Island City data 
centre are estimated to be $12,825,200, with $10,260,200 proposed from the regular 
budget and $2,565,000 proposed from the peacekeeping budget. The requirements 
for the North Lawn migration from the Secretariat data centre are estimated to be 
$8,514,100, with $6,811,300 proposed from the regular budget and $1,702,800 
proposed from the peacekeeping budget.

114. A major part of the budget requirements are related to the purchase of new 
hardware (servers, firewalls, uninterruptible power supply and racks, tape libraries, 
storage area network and Internet Protocol telephony equipment) to support the data 
migration. This equipment, referred to as “seed equipment”, needs to be preinstalled 
to avoid any downtime during the migration and transfer of the existing equipment 
from the old data centres to the new data centres. Additional funds are requested for 
the communication infrastructure and contractual services that will need to be built 
in both Long Island City and the North Lawn to ensure connectivity between the 
United Nations buildings and the new data centres. Three temporary migration 
managers are proposed to be funded from general temporary assistance commencing 
in January 2009. 

115. As of year three, there will be annual recurrent costs for maintenance of the 
hardware and software components, which are estimated at $1,680,400 in annual 
recurrent expenditure. Twenty per cent of the actual activities of the current data 
centres are related to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations/Department of 
Field Support and therefore it is proposed that 20 per cent of the annual recurrent 
costs ($336,100) be funded by peacekeeping. Capital expenditure will also be 
incurred periodically on additional storage capacity to accommodate growth in the 
volume of data to be stored and will be proposed as part of future proposed 
programme budgets for capital improvements. 
 
 

 X. Conclusions and recommendations 
 
 

116. Based on the current condition of the data centres and the potential impact of 
the capital master plan on the continuity of ICT operations, the Secretary-General is 
committed to establishing an alternative data centre facility to preserve United 
Nations Headquarters capability during and after this period. The implementation of 
this proposal would give rise to additional activities and resource requirements of 
$36,043,500 under the regular budget for the biennium 2008-2009 comprising 



 A/62/477
 

35 07-53440 
 

$18,972,000 for the construction and lease costs of the proposed Long Island City 
data centre, $10,260,200 for the equipment needed for the establishment of the Long 
Island City data centre and $6,811,300 for the equipment for the North Lawn data 
centre. 

117. The Secretary-General believes that it is essential that the Organization 
proceed with implementation of the business continuity and disaster recovery 
project without further delay. It is therefore requested that, in the interest both of 
maintaining the reliability of United Nations Headquarters information services and 
of implementing the capital master plan, a decision be made to proceed with an 
ancillary project to lease space and fit out a secondary data centre and office space 
for incoming staff/contractors/consultants in Long Island City and furthermore to 
actively pursue the opportunity for the secondary data centre to be shared among 
multiple organizations, on a cost-sharing basis.

 II. Action to be taken by the General Assembly: regular budget 
 
 

119. The General Assembly is requested to approve the additional resource 
requirements for the biennium 2008-2009 of $30,261,400 under section 28D, Office 
of Central Support Services, $16,924,700 under section 32, Construction, alteration, 
improvement and major maintenance, and $106,800 under section 35, Staff 
assessment, to be offset by an equivalent amount under income section 1, Income 
from staff assessment. 

120. Consequently, an additional provision of $47,186,100 would be required over 
and above the resources of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-
2009. That provision would represent a charge against the contingency fund and, as 
such, would require appropriations for the biennium 2008-2009 to be approved by 
the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. 

121. The General Assembly is also requested to approve the establishment of two 
posts at the P-5 level under section 28D, Office of Central Support Services. 
 
 

 III. Action to be taken by the General Assembly: peacekeeping 
 
 

122. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the 
financing of the secondary active communications facility are: 

 (a) To approve the proposed location at Valencia, Spain, of the secondary 
active telecommunications facility; 

 (b) To take note of the intention to meet the additional proposed requirement 
not exceeding $202,200 to finance the requirements of the secondary active 
telecommunications facility, to be prorated from within the already approved 
resources of individual peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2007 to 
30 June 2008; 

 (c) To also take note of the intention to meet the requirement not exceeding 
$96,500 in general temporary assistance provisions in respect of the P-5 and 
General Service positions for site B, to be prorated from within the already 
approved resources of individual peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 
2007 to 30 June 2008; 

 (d) To further take note of the intention to meet, from within the already 
approved resources of the support account for peacekeeping operations for the 
period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008, the requirement for general temporary 



 A/62/477
 

37 07-53440 
 

assistance provisions in respect of the P-5 position in the Department of Field 
Support. 

123. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the 
peacekeeping operations share of the Long Island City and North Lawn data centres 
are: 

 (a) To take note of the negotiations currently under way with the United 
Nations organizations, funds and programmes in respect of the cost-sharing 
arrangement including that portion of the proposed peacekeeping support account 
budget for the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009; 

 (b) To also take note of the additional requirement not exceeding $389,100 
towards the share of the design and rental costs of the North Lawn and Long Island 
City data centres to be prorated from within the already approved resources of 
individual peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008.
