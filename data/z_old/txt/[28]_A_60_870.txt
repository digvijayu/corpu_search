  Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions 
 
 

 I. Introduction 
 
 

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has 
considered the report of the Secretary-General entitled “Investing in the United 
Nations for a stronger Organization worldwide: detailed report” (A/60/846 and 
Add.1-4). During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with 
representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and 
clarification. 

2. The report of the Secretary-General was submitted in response to General 
Assembly resolution 60/260 of 8 May 2006 and builds upon his previous report on 
investing in the United Nations (A/60/692 and Corr.1). The report consists of an 



A/60/870  
 

2 06-37253 
 

introductory main document (A/60/846), which summarizes the approach taken by 
the Secretary-General and the main proposals, and four addenda, which deal with 
the following areas: 

 (a) Information and communication technology (A/60/846/Add.1); 

 (b) Budget implementation (A/60/846/Add.2); 

 (c) Financial management practices (A/60/846/Add.3); 

 (d) Improving reporting mechanisms, including public access to United 
Nations documentation (A/60/846/Add.4). 

3. The Advisory Committee notes that the report of the Secretary-General has 
been presented in a timely manner and that it takes into account elements contained 
in the Committee’s report of 24 March 2006, in which it requested inclusion of 
background information on the history of the proposals, financial and administrative 
implications and projected time lines for implementation, among other things 
(A/60/735 and Corr.1, para. 8). The report, however, treats some subjects more 
comprehensively than others and in some areas lacks clarity and/or detail. The 
Committee comments further on this in its discussion of the specific proposals. 

4. The detailed report (A/60/846 and Add.1-4) does not address all of the 
proposals in the Secretary-General’s initial report on investing in the United Nations 
(A/60/692 and Corr.1). Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with 
the following table showing the status of each of the proposals presented in the 
initial report:

  Accountability 
 

6. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in its report on the initial proposals by 
the Secretary-General, it pointed out that a set of principles to ensure accountability 
is key to the successful management of any organization, and drew attention to the 
need to specifically define what is meant by accountability in the United Nations 
context and to set out the parameters of its application and the instruments for its 
vigorous enforcement (A/60/735 and Corr.1, para. 6). Subsequently, the General 
Assembly requested the Secretary-General, in the context of the reports it requested 
relating to the reform proposals, to specifically define accountability as well as clear 
accountability mechanisms, including to the Assembly, and to propose clear 
parameters for its application and the instruments for its rigorous enforcement, 
without exception, at all levels (resolution 60/260, sect. I, para. 2).  

7. The concept of accountability encompasses both the accountability of the 
Organization as an institution to Member States and the accountability of staff for 
performance; there are different processes and mechanisms for each. In his report, 
the Secretary-General makes reference to the accountability framework set out in 
his report on measures to strengthen accountability at the United Nations 
(A/60/312), and discusses aspects of the proposals which would strengthen the tools 
to demonstrate accountability and thereby increase transparency. In this regard, the 
Advisory Committee wishes to emphasize the importance of the following elements: 
adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), 
strengthening capacity in the area of information and communications technology, 
improving reporting mechanisms and increasing public access to United Nations 
documentation. 

8. The Advisory Committee welcomes the steps taken thus far. It points out 
that a complete system of accountability requires further development in 
accordance with all applicable General Assembly resolutions, including 
resolution 60/260, with particular attention to the following: (a) a clear 
definition of accountability in all areas, including finance, administration and 
human resources management; (b) tools to implement accountability; (c) an 
effective system for the administration of justice; and (d) consistent regulations 
and rules. The Committee notes that the International Civil Service Commission, in 
its framework for human resources management (A/55/30, annex II), defines 
accountability (as it applies to human resources) as a: 

“Concept which implies taking ownership of all responsibilities and honouring 
commitments; delivering outputs for which the staff member has responsibility 
within prescribed time, cost and quality standards; operating in compliance 
with organizational regulations and rules; supporting subordinates, providing 
oversight and taking responsibility for delegated assignments; taking personal 
responsibility for personal shortcomings and, where applicable, those of the 
work unit”. 

9. The Committee recalls that, in its first report on the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 2006-2007, it recommended a number of measures that 
could be taken to strengthen accountability, including sanctions for failure to 
perform and provisions for rewarding performance that exceeds expectations.1 The

paras. 56-61. 



 A/60/870

Committee recognizes that the development of a fully functioning system of 
accountability is a work in progress and notes in this regard that reports to the 
General Assembly on human resources management, the administration of justice 
and oversight, which will further address accountability arrangements, are 
forthcoming. The Committee requests the Secretary-General to give the issue of 
accountability priority attention in the elaboration and implementation of 
reform measures. The Committee draws attention to the human resources 
reform proposals to be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-first 
session, which should take full account of all applicable General Assembly 
resolutions.2 
 
 

 II. Information and communication technology 
(A/60/846/Add.1) 
 
 

10. In A/60/846/Add.1, the Secretary-General elaborates proposals concerning 
investment in information and communication technology at the United Nations. 
The specific action to be taken by the General Assembly is outlined in paragraph 80 
of the document. The observations and recommendations of the Advisory 
Committee are contained in paragraphs 11 to 23 below. 
 
 

 A. Chief Information Technology Officer 
 
 

11. The Secretary-General proposes the creation of a post of Chief Information 
Technology Officer at the level of Assistant Secretary-General and the establishment 
of the Office of Information and Communications Technology only after the 
appointment of the Chief. The incumbent would carry sufficient central authority to 
effectively manage directly or through appropriate delegation all information and 
communication technology (ICT) activities throughout the Secretariat, including 
Headquarters, offices away from Headquarters, peacekeeping and special political 
missions and other field offices. The Chief would also provide vision, leadership 
and expertise to the Organization on ICT matters. Decisions on significant 
information technology investment initiatives would be made by the Management 
Committee, of which the Chief would be a member, on the basis of proposals made 
by the Chief. He or she would chair the Technology Steering Committee, composed 
of information management specialists as well as managers from Headquarters and 
the field, which would make major decisions on technology direction.  

12. The Advisory Committee has, on numerous occasions, expressed the view that 
there is a need for a senior position of Chief Information Technology Officer of the 
United Nations with responsibilities for developing the ICT strategy, operational 
policies and procedures as well as the most appropriate structure for the ICT service. 
Also, the Committee has emphasized the importance of appointing to the post an 
expert who has extensive professional experience in running the day-to-day ICT 
operations of a large, complex organization, in-depth knowledge of enterprise 
resource planning systems, and proven managerial and leadership ability. 

13. In his initial report on the most recent reform initiative, the Secretary-General 
noted that at least six departments had their own ICT units and that there was no

functioning integrating mechanism, resulting, inter alia, in fragmented systems, 
duplication of efforts, lack of knowledge-sharing and failure to fully exploit the 
potential of information and communication technologies to enable and support 
management reforms (A/60/692 and Corr.1, paras. 47-52). The Secretary-General 
explains that this largely dysfunctional ICT situation stems from legacy systems and 
practices built up over decades. In this connection, the Advisory Committee points 
out that the offices away from Headquarters and the regional commissions also have 
their own ICT units, which dispose of considerable resources and autonomy. 
Furthermore, in some cases, multiple units are responsible for providing ICT 
services within a given department: for example, the Office of Programme Planning, 
Budget and Accounts and the Office of Human Resources Management in the 
Department of Management.  

14. The Advisory Committee recommends the creation of a post of Chief 
Information Technology Officer at the Assistant Secretary-General level 
through redeployment, on the understanding that the incumbent would head an 
office which would integrate the Information Technology Services of the 
Department of Management and the Communication and Information 
Technology Service of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and provide 
Secretariat-wide leadership, including for the information technology functions 
of offices away from Headquarters.3 
 
 

 B. Upgrading of the Secretariat-wide information and 
communication technology systems 
 
 

15. In his report (A/60/846/Add.1), the Secretary-General indicates that an in-
depth fact-finding study was initiated to address the request of the General 
Assembly for a detailed report (resolution 60/260, sect. IV, para. 1) and that the 
study would be completed and a detailed costing and timetable provided to the 
Assembly for consideration at its sixty-first session. The Secretary-General also 
indicates that the report provided preliminary findings and a high-level road map 
charting a future course for investing in ICT (A/60/846/Add.1, para. 18). 

16. The Secretary-General advises that most of the new reform proposals cannot 
be implemented without appropriate ICT support, but that the fragmented and 
outdated nature of the overall ICT system makes it difficult to adapt the systems in 
place to the new and evolving requirements. The Committee recalls that in the 
revised ICT strategy issued in November 2002 (A/57/620), the Secretary-General 
indicated that the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) would 
continue to play a pre-eminent role in the administrative processes of the Secretariat 
for at least the ensuing five years. The report under consideration indicates that 
IMIS is approaching the end of its life cycle and becoming technologically obsolete. 
The Advisory Committee has also frequently pointed out some of the weaknesses in 
the ICT systems and governance mechanisms of the United Nations.4 The

reduction in the Secretary-General’s estimate of $145,600 net for salaries and $166,000 for 
office costs.

difficulties of integrating IMIS with other systems such as the Integrated Monitoring 
and Documentation Information System (IMDIS) and the Budget Information 
System (BIS) were demonstrated, for example during the introduction of results-
based budgeting techniques. It is evident that the Organization does not yet have 
adequate management information systems and, in the opinion of the Advisory 
Committee, that it should move rapidly towards overcoming its deficiencies in 
this critical area. The Committee reiterates its view that the proposals of the 
Secretary-General should lead to greater benefits by eliminating duplication, 
streamlining processes, increasing efficiency and productivity, improving 
financial controls and ensuring that accurate and timely information is 
available for performance management, oversight and decision-making. 

17. The Secretary-General’s proposals and the preliminary cost estimates of $120 
million are based on an IMIS gap study conducted in March 2005 to identify the 
weaknesses of the system and to evaluate the options for upgrading or replacing the 
United Nations ICT systems (see A/60/846/Add.1, paras. 63-65). The study 
demonstrates the need for the adoption of a next generation enterprise resource 
planning system rather than an upgrade of IMIS, referred to as IMIS+. 

18. Upon request the Advisory Committee was provided a copy of the IMIS gap 
study. A summary of the functional gaps identified in IMIS and other existing tools 
against strategic requirements in the areas of financial management, human resource 
management and supply chain management, as well as IMIS systems gaps and 
issues, is presented in annex II to the present report; the special needs of the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which are not served by IMIS are also 
identified.  

19. The Secretary-General appears to link the timetable for the replacement of 
IMIS to the information technology needs and constraints arising from the adoption 
of IPSAS (A/60/846/Add.1, para. 74; see also paras. 38-42 below). In the opinion 
of the Committee, a decision on the enterprise resource planning or any other 
solution proposed can be made only after the detailed report of the Secretary-
General is submitted and extensive deliberations on the subject have taken 
place (see para. 15 above).  

20. The Advisory Committee emphasizes that the detailed study envisaged 
should be comprehensive and cover the needs of all users of the administrative 
and management systems, including those at peacekeeping missions, other field-
based operations, offices away from Headquarters and regional commissions 
(see General Assembly resolution 60/260). The Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations should be fully engaged from the start of the process. It is of 
paramount importance that the new systems are not applied to poor methods of 
work and that business processes are reviewed carefully and reformed as an 
integral part of the project. Also, the Committee requests that the needs of 
Member States be kept in mind. The analysis of cost aspects should examine all 
cost drivers over the enterprise resource planning life cycle, as well as the costs 
related to any transition from IMIS.  

21. The implementation of an enterprise resource planning system is a major 
endeavour that will affect the entire Organization and the management of its 
operations for many years. As indicated by the Secretary-General, preliminary 
estimates of the costs of such a system point to an investment of some $120 
million (A/60/846/Add.1, para. 66). The decision to replace IMIS with a next-



A/60/870  
 

8 06-37253 
 

generation enterprise resource planning system must therefore be based on 
complete, accurate information and comprehensive, rigorous analyses. The 
Advisory Committee will make its recommendation on the basis of the detailed 
report and costing plan to be submitted by the Secretariat to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-first session. 

22. The Advisory Committee notes the Secretariat’s intention to explore the 
potential for creating a fast-track process for managing resources and procurement 
(A/60/846/Add.1, para. 75). The Committee emphasizes that special attention 
should be paid to ensuring that any measures proposed in this respect 
guarantee full accountability and transparency and are completed in strict 
application of United Nations regulations and rules. 

23. The cost estimates for the additional resources required to carry out the 
detailed cost study and implementation plan amount to a total of $2,215,200 
(A/60/846/Add.1, para. 79). This includes $300,000 under section 28D, Office of 
Central Support Services, $1,500,000 for consultancy services under section 28A, 
Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management and $55,200 under section 
35, Staff assessment, to be offset by an equal amount under section 1, Income from 
staff assessment, under the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007. A 
further $360,000 under section 28A, Office of the Under-Secretary-General for 
Management, of the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007, is requested 
for general temporary assistance for the temporary replacement of staff seconded to 
the user needs definition process. The Advisory Committee recommends 
acceptance of these requested resources.  
 
 

 III. Budget implementation (A/60/846/Add.2) 
 
 

24. The Secretary-General’s proposals concerning limited budgetary discretion 
during budget implementation are contained in A/60/846/Add.2. The specific action 
to be taken by the General Assembly is outlined in paragraph 35. The observations 
of the Advisory Committee are contained in paragraphs 25 to 36 below.  
 
 

 A. Transfers between sections of the budget 
 
 

25. Proposals related to the transfer of appropriations between budget sections are 
contained in paragraphs 35 (a) and (b) of A/60/846/Add.2. The Advisory Committee 
notes, as indicated by the Secretary-General in paragraph 6 thereof, that current 
proposals are presented in modified form in comparison with that contained in the 
initial report of the Secretary-General (A/60/692 and Corr.1, proposal 16). 

26. As indicated in paragraph 15 of A/60/846/Add.2, parts VII to IX and XI to 
XIV would be excluded from the authority to transfer resources between sections 
since they each contain only one section. Upon request, the Advisory Committee 
was provided with a breakdown of the amounts approved for 2006-2007, both for 
parts with more than one section and for those containing only one (see annex III).  

27. As can be seen from the table in annex III, the total amount approved by the 
General Assembly for 2006-2007 in resolution 60/247 A of 23 December 2005 
amounts to $3,798,912,500 gross ($3,401,084,600 net). It is not clear from the 
parameters defined in paragraph 16 (f) of A/60/846/Add.2 whether the request for 



 A/60/870
 

06-37253 9 
 

authority to move not more than 10 per cent of the approved budget refers to the 
gross or the net budget. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the amount 
proposed was intended to be 10 per cent of the net budget.  

28. The Secretary-General has, at present, the authority to transfer funds within 
sections of the budget subject to the provisions of General Assembly resolution 
55/231 of 23 December 2000. In paragraph 17 of that resolution, the Assembly 
decided that any transfer of resources between post and non-post objects of 
expenditure would require its prior approval. For the present 2006-2007 biennium, 
the Secretary-General may transfer funds between sections of the budget with the 
concurrence of the Advisory Committee (Assembly resolution 60/247 A, para. 2). 
Paragraphs 9 to 14 of A/60/846/Add.2 provide background information on the 
flexibility currently available to the Secretary-General, as well as a history of this 
authority.  

29. The Advisory Committee has, in the past, called for the Secretary-General to 
be given greater flexibility. In this connection, the Committee recalls that, in 
connection with the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1992-1993, it 
recommended that every effort should be made to achieve a more flexible 
application of the procedure for transfers between sections of the budget.5 In 
relation to results-based budgeting, the Committee pointed to the need to bear in 
mind the general principle that additional flexibility should be accompanied by 
additional accountability (A/55/543, para. 16). The Advisory Committee reiterates 
that additional flexibility must be accompanied by a comprehensive and 
effective system of accountability (see paras. 6-9 above and General Assembly 
resolution 60/260, sect. I, para. 1). This includes the accountability of the 
Secretary-General to Member States, bearing in mind that it is the General 
Assembly which continues to exercise overall authority over the finances of the 
Organization, in accordance with Article 17 of the Charter. 

30. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in paragraph 35 of 
its resolution 57/300 of 20 December 2002, took note of the request of the 
Secretary-General for a degree of flexibility to reallocate resources between 
programmes and between allocations for personnel and other allocations within a 
single budget period and in exceptional circumstances, and requested the Secretary-
General to develop criteria for the use of any such authorization, proposed 
modalities for reporting the duration and programmatic impacts of reallocations, 
including specification of the exceptional circumstances in which it would be used, 
and to report thereon to the Assembly, through the Advisory Committee, for its 
consideration at its fifty-eighth session. The Committee was informed that the 
requested report has not been submitted. 

31. The Advisory Committee studied the proposals of the Secretary-General 
against the above-mentioned background. It is, however, of the opinion that the 
current proposals of the Secretary-General lack sufficient clarity and detail to 
be ripe for consideration at the present stage (see also para. 3 above). For 
example, the Committee notes in paragraph 16 (f) of A/60/846/Add.2 a reference to 
“10 per cent of the approved programme budget”. However, in paragraph 35 (a) of 
the document, the Secretary-General requests authorization to “transfer up to 10 per 
cent of appropriations”. Aside from the question of whether this amount is of the net

para. 22. 



A/60/870  
 

10 06-37253 
 

or the gross budget (see the clarification in para. 27 above), the Committee was 
unable to establish definitively whether the 10 per cent refers to the entire budget or 
to individual sections of the budget; moreover, if it does refer to the entire budget, it 
is unclear if the amount is to be 10 per cent of the whole, or only 10 per cent of the 
total appropriation for those parts which contain more than one section. Further 
complicating the matter, the proposed amendment to financial regulation 5.6, as 
contained in paragraph 35 (b) of A/60/846/Add.2, makes no reference to any 
percentage at all, but simply provides for a blanket authority “to make transfers 
between appropriation sections, within parts, during implementation of the budget”. 
Also, the Committee notes the lack of a full response to the requests of the General 
Assembly in paragraph 35 of its resolution 57/300 (see para. 30 above). 

32. Under the circumstances, the Advisory Committee recommends that the 
General Assembly request the Secretary-General to rework his proposal. His 
resubmission should clarify the issues referred to in paragraphs 29 to 31 above 
and establish that the integrity of the programme budget process would 
continue to be respected. The Secretary-General should also provide a full 
analysis and justification of the scope and level of discretionary authority 
requested, including information on any instance in which the need for greater 
discretionary authority was made evident.  

33. As pointed out in paragraph 28 above, the Secretary-General does not 
currently have the authority to effect transfers between post and non-post resources, 
even within sections. However, in actuality such transfers are made and reported in 
the first and second performance reports. While this technically complies with 
current procedures (since the performance reports contain only proposed 
estimates), the Advisory Committee is of the view that the situation should be 
rectified and that the Secretary-General should submit a proposal in this 
regard as soon as possible.  
 
 

 B. Adjustments to the staffing table 
 
 

34. In paragraph 35 (c) of A/60/846/Add.2, the Secretary-General proposes that 
the General Assembly approve three broad grouping of posts for budgetary 
implementation, namely (a) category I: D-1/D-2; (b) category II: P-1 to P-5, 
inclusive of National Officer and Field Service posts; (c) category III: General 
Service (Other level), General Service (Principal level), Local level and Trades and 
Crafts. In paragraphs 35 (d) and (e), the Secretary-General proposes that he be 
requested to ensure that, in exercising management of the groups of posts, the 
staffing table for the Secretariat as a whole and the level of the overall appropriation 
be respected and that he report to the General Assembly on the management of the 
staffing table in the context of the first and second performance reports on the 
programme budget.  

35. The Advisory Committee notes that, in accordance with the parameters defined 
in the report (A/60/846/Add.2, paras. 28-32), authority would be granted to the 
Secretary-General, within the approved staffing table for the Secretariat as a whole 
for a given budget period, for post actions (redeployment, reclassification and 
conversion) to be undertaken for up to 10 per cent of posts within and between the 
three broad categories without affecting the total number of posts authorized for the 



 A/60/870
 

06-37253 11 
 

period. As noted in paragraph 28 of the report, the Secretary-General is not seeking 
any discretionary authority with regard to the creation or suppression of posts. 

36. The Advisory Committee, as noted in the report A/60/846/Add.2, has 
consistently supported greater discretionary authority in this area. In this 
connection, the Committee recalls that, in its first report on the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, it recommended that the 
staffing table should be managed as a whole and that existing authority for the 
Secretary-General to reclassify posts be refined so as to provide the ability to 
reclassify posts from G-1 to G-6 and from P-1 to P-5, provided that the overall 
number of posts in each grade does not change.6 The General Assembly has yet 
to definitively pronounce itself on these recommendations (see General 
Assembly resolution 60/246). Moreover, any proposals to redeploy up to 10 per 
cent of posts within or between the specified categories is linked to the proposal 
concerning transfers between budget sections and, as such, needs to be clarified 
(see para. 31 above). The Advisory Committee will therefore reserve judgement 
on this proposal until the Assembly has made a policy decision on the matter.  
 
 

 IV. Financial management practices (A/60/846/Add.3) 
 
 

37. The proposals of the Secretary-General concerning the adoption of IPSAS, the 
financial management of peacekeeping operations, the level of the commitment 
authority for peacekeeping operations, the level of the Working Capital Fund, the 
treatment of budget surpluses, the establishment of a fund to accommodate 
unanticipated expenditures arising from exchange rate fluctuations and inflation and 
the charging of interest on arrears in a Member State’s assessed contributions are 
contained in A/60/846/Add.3. The specific action to be taken by the General 
Assembly on all of these proposals is outlined in paragraph 112 of the document. 
The observations and recommendations of the Advisory Committee are contained in 
paragraphs 38 to 65 below. 
 
 

 A. International Public Sector Accounting Standards 
 
 

38. In paragraph 22 of A/60/846/Add.3, the Secretary-General proposes the 
adoption by the United Nations of IPSAS as part of a United Nations system-wide 
adoption of IPSAS by 2010 at the latest, and the appropriation of $2,009,700. As 
noted in paragraph 12 of the document, the United Nations System Chief Executives 
Board for Coordination (which is chaired by the Secretary-General) has endorsed a 
recommendation from its High-level Committee on Management for the adoption of 
IPSAS throughout the United Nations system. Upon request, the Advisory 
Committee was provided with a description of the basic differences between the 
United Nations System Accounting Standards (UNSAS) and IPSAS, together with a 
summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the latter (see annex VI.A). 

39. The Secretary-General’s proposal is based on phased implementation within 
the broader United Nations system, by which a few pilot organizations, or early 
adopters, would implement the Standards effective 1 January 2008, while the 
majority of organizations would implement them effective 1 January 2010. Upon

request, the Advisory Committee was provided with a table showing the timing of 
submission of reports concerning the adoption of IPSAS to the governing bodies of 
the organizations of the United Nations system (see annex IV). 

40. At present, the Secretary-General estimates the costs to be borne by the United 
Nations from 2006 to 2010 at $23 million (see A/60/846/Add.3, annex II). For the 
biennium 2006-2007, estimated requirements amounting to $2,009,700 provide for 
four posts (1 P-5, 1 P-4, 1 P-3 and 1 General Service (Other level)) and related costs 
under section 28B, Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts 
($1,428,900), section 28D, Office of Central Support Services ($108,600) and 
section 35, Staff assessment ($48,200), to be offset by an equivalent amount under 
income section 1, Income from staff assessment, as well as for estimated 
requirements under section 30, Jointly financed administrative activities ($424,000) 
relating to the portion of cost-shared system-wide activities. Upon request, the 
Committee was provided with additional information concerning the functions to be 
carried out by the staff requested (see annex V).  

41. As indicated in paragraph 18 of A/60/846/Add.3, the United Nations strategy 
is to integrate the adoption of IPSAS into the proposed upgrading of its information 
technology systems and the replacement of IMIS with an enterprise resource 
planning system. As noted in paragraph 19 of the document, IPSAS are compatible 
with off-the-shelf accounting software. A provisional timetable for the adoption and 
implementation of IPSAS by the United Nations is provided in annex II to the 
document.  

42. It is clear to the Advisory Committee that the Organization should move 
from UNSAS to IPSAS. Inasmuch as the decision to replace IMIS with a next-
generation enterprise resource planning system is contingent upon the 
completion of the comprehensive report proposed by the Secretary-General in 
paragraph 80 (d) of A/60/846/Add.1, it is the view of the Committee that the 
proposed timetable for implementation should be realistic and would need to be 
synchronized with the introduction of any new information technology system. 
The Committee therefore recommends the adoption of IPSAS and approval of 
the requested resources to begin its implementation, with the stipulation that 
expenditure relating to the information technology aspect of implementation 
should await a definitive decision by the Assembly on the system to be used. 
 
 

 B. Financial management of peacekeeping operations 
 
 

 (a) Consolidation of peacekeeping accounts 
 
 

 (b) Consolidation of resolutions on the financing of peacekeeping operations 
 
 

 (c) Consolidation of peacekeeping assessments 
 
 

 (d) Delinking of peacekeeping assessments from Security Council mandates 
 
 

 (e) Utilization of unencumbered balances, interest and other miscellaneous income 
 
 

 (f) Consolidation of individual performance reports 
 
 



 A/60/870
 

06-37253 13 
 

 (g) Credits to Member States 
 
 

 (h) Settlement of outstanding liabilities in the accounts of closed peacekeeping 
operations 
 

43. The specific action to be taken by the General Assembly on the financial 
management of peacekeeping operations is outlined in paragraphs 36 and 112 (b) to 
(i) of A/60/846/Add.3. 

44. In paragraph 29 of the document, the Secretary-General indicates that the 
consolidation of peacekeeping accounts into a single account would permit more 
consistent and timely reimbursement to troop- and police-contributing countries, 
facilitate planning for Member States, facilitate the review of the financing of 
peacekeeping operations by the legislative bodies, allow greater flexibility in the use 
of peacekeeping resources and simplify the legislative and administrative processes 
for the financing of peacekeeping operations. 

45. The Advisory Committee notes the advantages described by the Secretary-
General. There are, however, certain difficulties, a number of which were referred to 
by the Committee in its report dated 4 April 2003 (A/57/772). In paragraph 27 of 
that report, the Committee noted that the Secretary-General himself had 
acknowledged that the approach outlined in his report of the feasibility of 
consolidating the accounts of the various peacekeeping operations (A/57/746) was 
not compatible with current financial procedures required under the Financial 
Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. Moreover, it pointed out, in particular, 
that the delinking of assessments from Security Council action on individual 
mandates might create complications for some Member States which, in accordance 
with their domestic legal requirements, require such Security Council action before 
they could pay assessments. 

46. In response to the Committee’s continued concern regarding the need to 
maintain a direct link between peacekeeping assessments and the specific mandates 
(mandate periods) approved for each mission by the Security Council, the 
Secretariat outlined an approach to consolidation which could be adopted to 
maintain the link. In this scenario, assessments would be issued four times during 
each peacekeeping financial period, that is, in July, October, January and April to 
coincide with the most current Security Council mandates. Each assessment would 
be based on the amount approved for each mission and prorated to reflect the 
duration of the mission’s Security Council mandate within the peacekeeping 
financial period. To reflect that approach, the Secretariat provided the Committee 
with a revised version of the proposal in paragraph 36 (d), which read, as follows: 

  “(d) Approve the issuance of consolidated peacekeeping assessments 
quarterly during each peacekeeping financial period (in July, October, January 
and April), based on the approved appropriation line for each peacekeeping 
mission and the mandate periods approved for each mission by the Security 
Council, subject to the provision that such assessments should also cover any 
outstanding unassessed appropriations from prior financial periods”. 

The Committee was also provided with an illustrative table showing the impact of 
consolidation while retaining the linkage between assessments and the mandate 
(mandate period) approved by the Security Council (see annex VII). 



A/60/870  
 

14 06-37253 
 

47. Thus, it appears that the problem of the delinking of assessments from 
Security Council action is being addressed. However, a more fundamental issue 
remains, namely, since peacekeeping operations have a history of problems 
with withheld or late payments, those which pay their assessments promptly 
and in full will be subsidizing those which do not. Indeed, the Secretary-
General acknowledges that overall availability of cash would continue to 
depend on the overall prompt payment of assessments by Member States 
(A/60/846/Add.3, para. 29 (a)). It is for Member States to decide whether or not 
the managerial advantages of consolidation of peacekeeping accounts outweigh 
this basic fact. Consideration of the related proposals of the Secretary-General 
(A/60/846/Add.3, paras. 112 (b)-(d) and (f)-(i)) depends on such decision as the 
General Assembly may take with regard to the underlying issue of 
consolidation of accounts. 

48. The Advisory Committee expects that, whatever the decision reached, the 
scope and quality of information provided on the financing of peacekeeping 
operations will remain undiminished.  
 
 

 C. Commitment authority for peacekeeping operations 
 
 

49. In paragraphs 59 and 112 (j) to (l) of A/60/846/Add.3, the Secretary-General 
proposes increasing the upper limit of the authority to enter into commitments from 
the present $50 million to $150 million, regardless of the number of Security 
Council decisions; increasing the delegation of commitment authority to the 
Advisory Committee to $150 million; and revising financial regulations 4.6 and 4.8 
accordingly.  

50. The current arrangements for commitment authority are set out in section IV, 
paragraph 1, of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994. The 
arrangements for commitment authority prior to the approval of a mandate were 
endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 56/292 of 27 June 2002. By its 
resolution 59/299 of 22 June 2005, the Assembly approved the inclusion of strategic 
deployment stocks replenishment within the commitment authority described in 
resolution 49/233 A (i.e., without raising the ceiling). The argument for raising the 
level of individual commitment authority is based on the perceived need to increase 
the speed with which strategic deployment stocks are reconstituted in order to 
maintain the readiness of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to deploy 
subsequent missions in a timely manner, as well as on the proposed inclusion in the 
pre-mandate authority of resources for a dedicated planning team in the Department 
of Peacekeeping Operations and technical assessment missions. The Secretary-
General asserts that the increase in the level of the commitment authority would 
permit the replenishment of strategic deployment stocks before the initial budget of 
mission is finalized and a commitment authority or appropriation with assessment is 
approved by the Assembly, “which can take up to 90 days” after the Security 
Council adopts a resolution (A/60/846/Add.3, para. 47). The estimated costs 
associated with the proposed rapid deployment sequence for a complex mission, as 
set out in the table following paragraph 48 of A/60/846/Add.3, amount to $153.6 
million and the estimated cost of the dedicated planning team of 43 temporary posts 
for a six-month period for a complex mission to $7.2 million. As indicated in 
paragraph 51 of the document, the composition of the dedicated planning team 
would be determined on a case-by-case basis and presented to the Advisory 



 A/60/870
 

06-37253 15 
 

Committee for its review and concurrence as part of the pre-mandate commitment 
authority.  

51. The Advisory Committee enquired as to whether there had been a case in 
which the existing $50 million ceiling applying to each Security Council decision 
had presented a problem. It was informed that only in the case of the Sudan had 
strategic deployment stocks shipped in the first 120 days of the start-up phase 
approached $50 million. The Committee was also informed that the mission 
foreseen for Darfur could come close to the $50 million; however, it was not clear 
what the structure of the mission would be. 

52. The Advisory Committee points out that the current level of commitment 
authority was set in 1994 in response to a spike in peacekeeping activities. One 
of the concerns in setting the level at that time was a desire to avoid putting in 
place permanent measures to deal with an anomaly. As was the case in 1994, it 
is not clear that the current heightened level of peacekeeping activity will 
continue. Furthermore, as noted in paragraph 39 of A/60/846/Add.3, under the 
terms of resolution 49/233 A, if a decision of the Security Council results in the 
need for the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the start-up 
phase of peacekeeping operations in an amount exceeding $50 million per 
decision of the Security Council, or exceeding a total of $150 million, the matter 
is brought to the General Assembly as soon as possible for a decision on 
commitment authority and assessment.  

53. Moreover, commitment authority, by its nature, is decided upon on an 
urgent basis for the start-up phase of a mission when there is no time for the 
considered reasoning that goes into preparing a full budget and setting up an 
organizational structure. The Committee has, in the past, cautioned the 
Secretariat not to present de facto budgets in connection with requests for 
commitment authority because the Committee does not want to be in a position 
in which it would, in essence, agree to a budget and all the decisions that go 
along with it, without the necessary time for proper elaboration and 
consideration. 

54. For the reasons stated above, the Advisory Committee recommends that 
the current procedures for granting of commitment authority be maintained. 
 
 

 D. Working Capital Fund 
 
 

55. In paragraphs 68 and 112 (m) of the addendum, the Secretary-General 
proposes an increase in the level of the Working Capital Fund from the current $100 
million to $250 million. The Advisory Committee recalls the views it expressed on 
the matter in 1990, as follows:  

 “In the opinion of the Advisory Committee, the Working Capital Fund is a 
mechanism for ensuring an orderly cash flow which can only work properly 
when the financial regime of the Organization is respected by Member States; 
an increase in its size should only be contemplated as a purely technical 
consequence of an increase in the size of the Organization’s assessed budgets 
and not as a solution to a political problem” (A/45/860, para. 4). 

56. In making his proposal, the Secretary-General notes that, in 1963, the level of 
the Fund ($40 million) represented 43.1 per cent of the annual budget. In 1981, in 



A/60/870  
 

16 06-37253 
 

response to the fact that the level of the Fund had declined to 6 per cent of the 
budget, the decision was made to increase it to $100 million. The level of the Fund 
has not changed since that time, despite proposals to increase it. The Advisory 
Committee was informed that, in 1981, $100 million represented 14.9 per cent of 
the budget for one year. It now stands at approximately 5.2 per cent of the current 
regular budget for one year. 

57. The Advisory Committee remains of the view (see A/60/735 and Corr.1, 
para. 29) that the proposal to increase the level of the Working Capital Fund 
and the manner in which any such increase would be financed, are policy 
matters for decision by the General Assembly.  
 
 

 E. Budget surpluses 
 
 

58. The Advisory Committee notes that the proposals of the Secretary-General do 
not apply to surpluses from efficiency gains, which, in accordance with General 
Assembly resolution 52/12 H of 9 January 1998, should be credited to the 
Development Account. As stated in paragraph 69 of the addendum, under financial 
regulations 5.3 to 5.5, budgetary surpluses are returned to Member States after a 
financial period. Those financial regulations have been suspended on a number of 
occasions as a measure to deal with the Organization’s financial problems. The 
current balance of retained surpluses stands at $124 million ($68.4 million for the 
regular budget, $19.6 million for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon 
(UNIFIL) and $36 million for the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF)/the 
United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF)). As the Secretary-
General points out, the extent to which such a measure achieves the objective of 
increasing the cash available to the Organization depends on the extent to which 
Member States pay the additional assessments stemming from the retention of 
surpluses. 

59. As indicated in paragraph 72 of A/60/846/Add.3, the Committee on 
Contributions has, in the past, considered the possibility of making the return of 
unencumbered balances and surpluses dependent on the status of a Member State’s 
payment of assessed contributions, as a measure to encourage the payment of 
arrears. It decided not to consider measures to encourage the payment of arrears 
further unless it receives guidance thereon from the General Assembly. 

60. In paragraph 75 A/60/846/Add.3, the Secretary-General proposes that the 
General Assembly may wish: (a) to decide on the temporary retention of budgetary 
surpluses through the suspension of the relevant parts of financial regulations 5.3, 
5.4 and 5.5; and (b) to decide whether the future distribution of surpluses might be 
applied to (i) establishing a fund to accommodate unanticipated expenditure arising 
from exchange rate fluctuations and inflation, (ii) meeting the Organization’s 
unfunded liabilities arising from the after-service health insurance scheme or  
(iii) financing an increase in the Working Capital Fund. 

61. The Advisory Committee points out that the General Assembly, which has 
recognized the end-of-service accrued benefit liabilities reported by the 
Secretary-General (see Assembly resolution 60/255 of 8 May 2006, sect. III, 
para. 3), has yet to take a decision on the measures proposed by the Secretary-
General in his report of 27 October 2005 (A/60/450 and Corr.1) to fund accrued 
liabilities for after-service health insurance benefits, which include proposals to 



 A/60/870
 

06-37253 17 
 

utilize budget surpluses. Therefore, action on the utilization of budget surpluses 
should await a decision by the Assembly on that matter. The Committee’s views 
on the establishment of a fund to cover unanticipated expenditures arising from 
exchange rate fluctuations and inflation are set out in paragraphs 62 to 64 
below. The Committee’s views on the proposal to increase the Working Capital 
Fund are contained in paragraphs 55 to 57 above. 
 
 

 F. Fund to accommodate unanticipated expenditures arising 
from exchange rate fluctuations and inflation 
 
 

62. In paragraphs 101 and 102 of A/60/846/Add.3, the Secretary-General proposes 
the establishment of a reserve fund for adjustments resulting from variations in 
respect of currency fluctuations, inflation in non-staff costs and statutory cost 
increases for staff and suggests that the Assembly may wish to consider the mode of 
funding such a reserve fund (through retained surpluses or by new assessments).  

63. As noted in paragraphs 96 to 98 of A/60/846/Add.3, the proposal for the 
establishment of such a reserve fund at an initial level of $150 million was 
submitted to the General Assembly in part D of the introduction to the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 (A/60/6 (Introduction)). The 
Advisory Committee commented on the proposal in its first report on the proposed 
programme budget for 2006-2007 (A/60/7, paras. 100 and 101) and again in its 
report on the Secretary-General’s initial reform proposal (A/60/735, para. 31). No 
decision was taken by the Assembly at the main part of its sixtieth session. 

64. The Advisory Committee’s position on this matter is well documented, 
both in its own reports and in the report of the Secretary-General under 
consideration (A/60/846/Add.3). The Committee remains of the view that the 
problems associated with the establishment of such a fund outweigh any 
possible advantages. It therefore, once again, recommends continuation of the 
current system, whereby requirements are adjusted annually on the basis of the 
most recent forecast by the Secretary-General of inflation and exchange rates. 
 
 

 G. Charging of interest on arrears in a Member State’s  
assessed contributions 
 
 

65. In paragraph 107 (a) of A/60/846/Add.3, the Secretary-General proposes that 
the General Assembly consider charging interest on Member States’ arrears of 
assessed contributions. The Advisory Committee is of the view that it is for the 
General Assembly to decide whether it wishes to revisit this issue.  
 
 

 V. Improving reporting mechanisms, including public  
access to United Nations documentation (A/60/846/Add.4)  
 
 

66. A/60/846/Add.4 details proposals concerning the development of a single 
annual report of the Secretary-General on the performance of the Organization, 
streamlining of management and finance-related reports and public access to United 
Nations documentation. Specific actions to be taken by the General Assembly are 
outlined in paragraph 49 of the addendum.  



A/60/870  
 

18 06-37253 
 

 A. Comprehensive annual report containing both financial  
and programme information 
 
 

67. In paragraph 49 (a) of A/60/846/Add.4, the Secretary-General proposes that 
the General Assembly may wish to take note of his intention to submit a single 
comprehensive annual report which would contain both financial and programme 
information. The proposed structure of the report is described in paragraph 12 of the 
addendum. The Committee notes, that as indicated in paragraph 17 of the 
addendum, requirements for the production of the 2005 report would be met from 
within resources approved under the programme budget for the biennium 2006-
2007, but that additional resources would be required in the future under section 1, 
Overall policymaking, direction and coordination, for annual audits of financial 
statements by the Board of Auditors. As indicated in the same paragraph, the 
quantum of resources and programmatic implications for the Board are currently 
under review by the Board. 

68. The Advisory Committee welcomes the intention of the Secretary-General 
to prepare and submit to the General Assembly a single comprehensive annual 
report containing both financial and programme information. However, in the 
view of the Committee, there is a need to define more clearly the purpose of the 
report and the target audience. In paragraph 9 of addendum 4, for example, the 
Secretary-General states that the report, “given its blending of strategic perspective 
and performance analysis of the key programmes, is intended to be a tool to enhance 
accountability of the Secretariat to Member States and to the public at large” and in 
paragraph 10 that it would “provide the information necessary for the General 
Assembly and the global public to assess the Organization’s performance and 
management of resources”. In paragraph 8, it is stated that the report “would not 
require action by Member States”.  

69. The Advisory Committee believes that the attempt to provide one report 
to serve the needs of both the general public and Member States will result in a 
document that is too technical for the former and too general for the latter. The 
Committee recommends therefore that, at this stage, the Secretary-General 
concentrate on developing a comprehensive financial and programme report 
for the General Assembly. The Committee also recommends that most of the 
appendices be eliminated; they would contain information which is, for the 
most part, readily available on websites or elsewhere. In the opinion of the 
Committee, the comprehensive financial and programme report would, for the 
time being, complement and not replace the report of the Secretary-General on 
the work of the Organization required under Article 98 of the Charter. 
 
 

 B. Consolidation of related reports 
 
 

70. In paragraph 49 (b) of A/60/846/Add.4, it is proposed that the General 
Assembly may wish to welcome the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General to 
consolidate reports on related subjects, if so decided by the Main Committees, and 
endorse the consolidation of 45 reports into 6, as reflected in annex I to  
addendum 4.  

71. The Advisory Committee welcomes efforts to consolidate reports, and has 
sought to do so in its own reporting on related subjects. The Committee notes 



 A/60/870
 

06-37253 19 
 

that the bulk of the reports to be consolidated (34) are dependent on a decision 
of the Assembly on the proposals to consolidate the financial performance 
reports and budgets of the peacekeeping operations as set out in addendum 2 to 
the report of the Secretary-General and discussed in paragraphs 43 to 47 
above. Should the General Assembly not accept those proposals, the 
consolidation would be from 45 reports to 38. 
 
 

 C. Public access policy 
 
 

72. In paragraph 49 (c) of A/60/846/Add.4, the Secretary-General proposes that 
the General Assembly may wish to take note of the Secretary-General’s new policy 
for public access to United Nations documentation, which is outlined in paragraphs 
31 to 41 of the addendum. Under the new policy, all United Nations departments 
and offices, including offices away from Headquarters, peacekeeping missions, 
special political missions and tribunals are to make available to the public any 
document produced or received by the United Nations, subject to a number of 
exceptions enumerated in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the addendum. The policy is to 
be implemented in two phases, the first from 2006 to May 2008, and the second 
from June 2008 onwards. The plan of action for implementation of the policy is set 
out in paragraphs 42 to 44 of addendum 4.  

73. It is estimated that total requirements will amount to $6,773,000. For the 
biennium 2006-2007, the Secretary-General requests appropriation of an amount of 
$1,820,900 to provide for three posts (1 P-5, 1 P-4 and 1 General Service (Other 
level)) and non-post resources under section 28 D, Office of Central Support 
Services ($1,743,800) and section 35, Staff assessment ($77,100) to be offset by an 
equivalent amount under income section 1, Income from staff assessment. Upon 
request, the Advisory Committee was provided with a detailed breakdown of the 
requirement (see annex VIII). 

74. The Advisory Committee welcomes the Secretary-General’s efforts to 
elaborate a clear and systematic policy for public access to United Nations 
documentation and trusts that the text of the policy, when it is fully elaborated, 
will be made available to the General Assembly. In the view of the Committee, 
before action is taken to implement the new policy, it is important to explore 
the possibility of a fee structure and financing mechanisms, where appropriate. 
The Committee also points to the importance of adequate measures to ensure 
multilingualism in accordance with General Assembly resolution 59/309 of 
22 June 2005.

 D. IMIS system gaps and issues 
 
 

Technical criteria IMIS observations and technical assessment 

Consolidation • Multiple databases feed into a reporting database but users have access to 
both the reporting database and field databases. Reports can therefore access 
conflicting versions of data depending on choice of database. No single, 
global, integrated view of data exists. Consolidation would require a major 
enhancement of the entire application. 

Integration • Modules not found in IMIS have either been purchased off the shelf and 
interfaced with IMIS on an as-needed basis or built internally by the IMIS 
team over time. IT portfolios and their corresponding databases have 
proliferated and thus do not work as a unified whole. Real-time information 
is next to impossible to access among heterogeneous systems. IMIS does not 
provide a strong base for integration. 



 A/60/870
 

06-37253 25 
 

Technical criteria IMIS observations and technical assessment 

Availability • Due to batch runs, maintenance and backups, access to IMIS can be limited 
at certain times. Users in the field are at times forced to alter work schedules 
in line with system availability. 

Speed • Application sometimes “stalls” and there is a lag time in processing the data 
entered. In existing IMIS, collection of information and application 
processing are integrated, which can reduce the speed of the application. The 
newer IMIS application allows IMIS to function like modern web-based 
applications, improving IMIS performance over a wide-area network. 

Security • No user-friendly integrated access to various IMIS and related system 
databases. 

User interface • User interface is not intuitive. Learning curve for new users is approximately 
3-6 months and users have noted vague error messages and need for detailed 
training and access to training manuals as barriers to making full use of the 
application. Only central access to the application is available from 
designated United Nations locations. 

Longevity • IMIS written in Java connected to a Sybase database. Existing IMIS depends 
on specialized technologies that have very small user communities, reducing 
their probability of longevity. The newer IMIS application elements are 
based on Java, which somewhat addresses this concern. 

 
 
 

 E. Special needs of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and 
other stakeholders

Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the 
United Nations 
(FAO) 

May/September 
2006 

To Council, in 
2007 

FAO raised the issue of IPSAS adoption with its Finance 
Committee in May 2006. Adoption by FAO will require a 
recommendation by the Finance Committee to the FAO 
Council and approval by the FAO Conference in 2007. At 
the May 2006 session, the Finance Committee expressed 
its agreement in principle with adoption of the new 
standards, subject to decisions on the matter by the 
General Assembly. The Finance Committee will consider 
in September 2006 formal approval of IPSAS adoption. 

International Atomic 
Energy Agency 
(IAEA) 

April/May 2006 IAEA has informally (at the Finance and Administrative 
Workshop, April 2006) and formally (to the Finance and 
Budget Committee, May 2006) presented the proposed 
“United Nations system-wide IPSAS adoption by 2010” 
to the member States. At this stage, IAEA does not have a 
definite time frame for presentation of the adoption 
proposal to the member States. 

International Civil 
Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) 

February/April 
2006 

In February 2006, the ICAO Secretary General informed 
its governing body (ICAO Council) concerning IPSAS 
adoption. In addition, the impact of the adoption was 
presented to the Finance Committee of the ICAO Council 
in April 2006, which approved the detailed changes in 
process and reporting. At its next session, in June 2006, 
the Council will consider the impact of IPSAS adoption 
on ICAO and will be invited to approve the 
implementation of the action plan for the IPSAS adoption 
in 2008. 

International Fund 
for Agricultural 
Development (IFAD) 

See comment IFAD has already adopted International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS). This is consistent with the 
IPSAS requirement that government business enterprises, 
including financial institutions such as banks and lending 
agencies, apply IFRS. 

International Labour 
Organization (ILO) 

June/November 
2006 

ILO has had an informal discussion on IPSAS adoption at 
the meeting of the Programme, Finance and

Annex V 
 

  Functions to be carried out by incumbents of the IPSAS 
posts to be established at the United Nations and 
peacekeeping operations 
 
 

1. Incumbents of the posts to be established will have the following 
responsibilities: 

 • Managing the United Nations and peacekeeping IPSAS adoption projects and 
ensuring delivery of the outputs identified in the projects’ terms of reference to 
all officers and staff performing accounting functions at offices, including 
offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions and peacekeeping 
missions. These outputs include: 

  ○ Developing project and workplans; 

  ○ Identifying the projects’ critical path; 

  ○ Liaising with any teams working on related projects, such as enterprise 
resource planning or revision of financial regulations and rules; 

  ○ Providing information to key project stakeholders; 

 • Specifying contracted deliverables, engaging consultants and ensuring that the 
contracted deliverables are provided as specified; 

 • Completing specific implementation tasks, including: 

  ○ Applying accounting policies to United Nations and peacekeeping specifics, 
including at peacekeeping missions, offices away from Headquarters and 
regional commissions (for example, determination of appropriate 
depreciation policies for vehicles, given their expected use and estimated 
useful life); 

  ○ Adding United Nations- and peacekeeping-specific details to IPSAS-
compliant model financial statements;  

  ○ Incorporation of United Nations- and peacekeeping-specific technical 
content in accounting manuals; 

  ○ Acting as lead trainers of United Nations and peacekeeping senior 
accounting staff to support training needs at all United Nations offices, 
including peacekeeping missions; 

  ○ Developing, documenting and communicating United Nations-specific and 
IPSAS-compliant accounting procedures and workflow; 

 • Working with the system-wide IPSAS adoption team to identify and resolve 
implementation issues, to develop system-wide accounting policy and 
guidance, provide United Nations and peacekeeping responses on draft IPSAS 
and contribute to shared system-wide implementation decisions. 

2. The incumbent of the P-5 post will be responsible for leading the team, 
developing project and work plans, identifying the project’s critical path, engaging 
consultants, ensuring that the contracted deliverables are provided as specified and 
liaising with teams that are dealing with related projects, such as Enterprise 



 A/60/870

Resource Planning and revisions of the Financial Regulations and Rules, and 
working closely with the system-wide IPSAS adoption team. The incumbent of the 
P-4 post will be responsible for taking into account budgetary requirements, 
applying accounting policy and ensuring compliance with IPSAS model financial 
statements. The incumbent of the P-3 post will be responsible for training 
requirements and documentation/communication on United Nations-specific and 
IPSAS-compliant accounting procedures and workflow. The incumbent of the GS 
(OL) post will provide support to the team. It is recalled that the general temporary 
assistance requirements to be funded under the peacekeeping support account would 
provide for one P-4 and one P-3 post to strengthen the IPSAS team with respect to 
peacekeeping operations, particularly concerning the development of appropriate 
capitalization and depreciation policies, control changes and procedural changes, 
inventory valuations, the review of guidelines and arrangements for accounting for 
the transfer of equipment between missions and upon liquidation.

Annex VI 
 

  International Public Accounting Standards 
 
 

 A. Description of the basic differences between IPSAS and UNSAS 
 
 

  IPSAS requirements are on an accruals basis, UNSAS requirements modified accruals 
 

1. UNSAS reporting requirements take a “modified accruals” approach that is 
very close to cash accounting. IPSAS requirements are on a full accruals basis. The 
effect of this is that IPSAS reports a larger group of items (assets and liabilities) on 
the balance sheet than does UNSAS. The pattern of expenses associated with these 
assets and liabilities is different. Under IPSAS, expenses associated with 
investments in assets are reported later than would be the case under UNSAS, while 
expenses associated with liabilities are reported earlier than would be the case under 
UNSAS. 
 

  IPSAS: Physical assets are capitalized and the related expense is reported as the 
asset is used 
 

2. Under IPSAS the value of assets such as vehicles, computers, food and 
medical supplies is included on the balance sheet (Statement of Assets, Liabilities 
and Reserves and Fund Balances) when the assets are first acquired. The expenses 
associated with these assets would be reported in an organization’s Statement of 
Income and Expenditure as follows: 

 • For assets such as cars or computers, their original cost is spread over their 
useful lives as the assets are used. The expenses are shown as “depreciation”. 

 • For inventory such as stamps, food and medical supplies, their cost is 
expensed when the item is sold, transferred or used up. 

3. Under UNSAS, such assets are not shown on the balance sheet. Instead, the 
cost of purchasing these assets is reported as expenditure in the Statement of Income 
and Expenditure, when the assets are purchased. 
 

  IPSAS: Employee obligations are reported as liabilities when the obligation occurs; 
the expense is reported at the same time 
 

4. IPSAS requires that liabilities for After-Service Health Insurance (ASHI), 
repatriation grants and accrued annual leave be reported on an organization’s 
balance sheet at the point that obligations are incurred. At the same time, the 
expense of these obligations must be reported. When the obligation is discharged by 
making payments or providing services to the employee, the reported liability is 
reduced accordingly. 

5. Under UNSAS, organizations have a choice of treatments and most 
organizations do not report any liabilities for obligations incurred with respect to 
repatriation grants, ASHI and accrued annual leave on the balance sheet. The 
expenditures arising from these employee obligations are reported in the Statement 
of Income and Expenditure some time after the obligation occurs, when the payment 
to the employee is made or the service provided. 
 



 A/60/870
 

06-37253 33 
 

  Qualitative differences between IPSAS and UNSAS  
 

6. There are also basic qualitative differences between IPSAS and UNSAS. 
IPSAS standards are more detailed and prescriptive than UNSAS standards and have 
more credibility and more depth, because of the more rigorous process through which 
they are developed. IPSAS are better quality accounting standards than are UNSAS. 
 
 

 B. Advantages and disadvantages of IPSAS 
 
 

Advantages Disadvantages 

IPSAS are credible, high-quality, independently 
produced accounting standards, underpinned by a 
strong due process. 

 

IPSAS are international accounting standards that 
represent current best practice for international 
organizations and meet best practice management 
requirements with respect to financial reporting. As 
IPSAS are consistent with accepted accounting 
practice, they will be more understandable to a wider 
group of financial statement users. 

IPSAS are not specially developed (customized) for 
United Nations needs. IPSAS are developed with the 
information needs of a range of organizations in mind 
and with the aim of convergence, to the extent possible, 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS). This means that it will be necessary to provide 
some additional guidance when they are applied in the 
United Nations for Organization-specific issues. 

IPSAS will improve the quality, consistency and 
comparability of United Nations financial reporting 
with consequential improvements in transparency, 
accountability, governance and financial management. 
For example, IPSAS requirements will make the 
present ASHI liability more visible by requiring that it 
be shown on the balance sheet. 

An initial drawback of adopting IPSAS will be that 
additional resources will be required for investment in: 
training for accounting and administration staff, 
communication with and education of managers and 
users of the financial statements; review and amendment 
of policies, procedures and financial regulations and 
rules. 

IPSAS adoption would enable the General Assembly to 
hold the Secretariat to a higher level of accountability 
for the proper management and tracking of its financial 
and non-financial assets. 

 

IPSAS requires full accrual accounting, which is 
necessary for best practice financial management and 
results in improved internal control and transparency 
with respect to assets and liabilities. 

IPSAS may result in initial additional costs related to 
changes to asset and liability management as a result of 
the improved information about these items. 

IPSAS will integrate non-expendable equipment into 
the accounting system, with resulting improvements in 
the accuracy and completeness of non-expendable 
equipment records. 

The increase in coverage of assets may require an 
increase in ongoing data entry, but modern information 
systems have been designed to facilitate this type of 
data capture. 

IPSAS provides more comprehensive information about 
costs that will better support results-based management. 

 

IPSAS will support more efficient use of United 
Nations financial and human resources and the efficient 
and effective conduct of its work. 

 



A/60/870  
 

34 06-37253 
 

Advantages Disadvantages 

IPSAS are supported by the Board of Auditors and the 
Panel of External Auditors, Governments, professional 
accounting bodies and international organizations, such 
as the International Organization of Supreme Audit 
Institutions (INTOSAI), the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the World 
Bank. 

Initial costs could arise relating to training, etc., as 
United Nations system auditors need to familiarize 
themselves with IPSAS requirements notwithstanding 
that auditors from some countries, for example 
Switzerland and South Africa, have already adopted 
IPSAS. 

IPSAS are consistent with “off-the-shelf” information 
systems and should reduce ongoing costs of 
information system upgrades. 

Without an upgrade or replacement of the present 
United Nations information system, IPSAS adoption 
will not be feasible.

mandate periods approved by the Security Council 
 
 

 In order to illustrate the impact of the implementation of the revised proposals 
for the consolidation of peacekeeping accounts, the table below compares actual 
assessments issued in the 2005-2006 financial period (including assessments 
expected to be issued in June 2006) under the present arrangements with those that 
would have been issued had the revised proposal for consolidation of peacekeeping 
accounts been implemented  — with provision for maintenance of the linkage 
between assessments issued and mandate periods approved by the Security Council.

1. The resource requests relate to the following four objectives in support of 
implementing the access to information policy. All objectives would be under the 
overall supervision of the Section Chief. In addition, travel of staff resources 
($60,000) would cover advisory/assessment missions to duty stations to meet all 
objectives of the information policy proposal, estimated at 10 trips. 
 

  Objective 1: Develop the strategic, substantive framework to implement  
the policy 
 

2. The substantive work programme for the policy will be developed through 
strategic and operational planning that will include: 

 • Related policies, information circulars, procedures and guidance; 

 • Oversight mechanism, reporting requirements; 

 • Development of a model action plan that will set out the steps to be taken by 
Secretariat offices to ensure they are ready to comply with the policy; 

 • Programme management, including reporting, liaison with the Secretariat, 
including alignment with the programmes of the Office of Internal Oversight

Services, the United Nations Archives and Records Management Section, the 
Department of Public Information outreach activities, etc. 

3. Associated resources for objective 1: 

 • 1 P-5 Section Chief, to oversee the above-mentioned tasks as well as the 
overall management of the programme; 

 • 1 GS (OL) to provide administrative support for the Section Chief, in areas 
such as human resources, procurement and financial management; 

 • Contractual services ($50,000) will provide expertise in information disclosure 
necessary to: 

 • Identify and provide specialized content for a suite of guidance and 
administrative issuances to support the policy; 

 • Advice on governance structures, such as the composition of review panels; 
oversight and reporting mechanisms; 

 • Identify for United Nations practice benchmarks of accepted international 
best practice 

 

  Objective 2: Implementation strategy: gap analysis of capability and 
capacity in records management  
 

4. The objective of this task is twofold: first to obtain a top-down view of 
information assets in the Organization; in turn this will enable Secretariat offices to 
begin to develop systems and practices that inform them as to the information they 
hold and where that information is, and to be able to distribute it in a timely and 
efficient manner. Second, a gap analysis of records management practice in the 
Secretariat will form the basis for targeted improvements as a necessary foundation 
for facilitating access to information. As a first stage, it is proposed to: 

 • Establish an inventory record created by United Nations offices;  

 • Develop a baseline standard, using the inventory, of categories of information 
that can be disclosed;  

 • Identify classified information that can be declassified and made available 

5. Associated resources for objective 2: 

 (a) General temporary assistance to manage inventory project and assist in 
inventory development at the United Nations Office at Vienna, the United Nations 
Office at Geneva, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 
the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Economic Commission 
for Africa, and the United Nations Office at Nairobi; 

 (b) Contractual services ($125,000) to advise offices at all duty stations in 
conducting the records inventory by: 

 • Developing a survey methodology and tool(s); 

 • On-site advisory service to staff delegated responsibility to inventory records 
(all duty stations); 

 • Analyse records and recommend:

 • Baseline standards for categories of information that can be disclosed; 

 • Records for priority declassification  

 • Develop an information assets inventory for dissemination on the website 
(inventory will be based on the survey results); 

 • Develop a road map and “model action plan” for use by Secretariat offices in 
preparing to implement the access to information policy 

 

  Objective 3: Communication, change management and training in the 
“model action plan” 
 

6. It is important to recognize that the access to information policy represents a 
significant shift in the way that the United Nations will deal with requests for 
information and it will bring about significant changes to the cultures of dealing 
with such requests and handling information generally. An internal and external 
communication strategy for members of the Secretariat and stakeholders, as well as 
comprehensive training and awareness-raising for staff at all duty stations, is 
planned, including workshops, feedback programmes, brochures, questionnaires, 
Web training, resources links and outreach to Member States. 

7. Associated resources for objective 3: 

 (a) General temporary assistance for project management and to coordinate 
translation and publication (through various means) of all materials; 

 (b) Contractual services ($200,000) will provide: 

 • Content development for training and development workshops; 

 • Workshop delivery at all duty stations; 

 • Digital (Web-based and CD-ROM) learning programme and toolkit for United 
Nations staff; 

 • Public information/outreach materials to promote awareness of the access to 
information policy 

 

  Objective 4: Develop information systems 
 

8. Specialized information systems will be required to support the request 
management process. In addition, a website as a “one-stop-shopping” site for the 
public and staff to request and receive information, and to learn more about 
information disclosure.  

9. Associated resources for objective 4: 

 (a) 1 P-4 post for an Information Management Officer to carry out business 
process analysis to develop requirements for the request management and appeals 
processes, and to manage implementation of the request management system. The 
P-4 will assume responsibility for daily operations of the request management 
system and information management systems; 

 (b) General temporary assistance to manage the website; link database of 
newly available information to the website; place on the Internet training materials 
and the inventory of information assets; 



 A/60/870

 (c) Software licenses ($40,000) for the United Nations standard software for 
content management and/or customer relations management; 

 (d) IT support ($96,000) to configure software to meet disclosure/request 
management requirements and compliance testing against United 
Nations/International Standards Organization (ISO) ICT information security 
standards; 

 (e) Contractual services ($25,000) to design and deliver a website covering 
all aspects of the information disclosure programme. 
 

  Premises and related equipment and supplies 
 

10. A total of $248,200 provides for the central support services requirements for 
the associated staffing (posts and general temporary assistance). It is based on 
standard costs and comprises rental of premises ($61,100), fit-out of premises 
($88,800), furniture and equipment ($45,400), communications and IT costs 
($32,200) and office supplies ($20,700). 
 
 

 B. Annual performance report 
 
 

11. With the proposed introduction of the annual report on the performance of the 
Organization, the annual report of the Secretary-General on the work of the 
Organization will continue to be produced. 

12. The proposed annual performance report will focus on linking policy 
priorities, programme activities and resources, and on management challenges and 
corrective actions, thereby providing the information necessary for the General 
Assembly and the global public to assess the Organization’s performance and 
management of resources. In addition, as indicated in paragraph 8 of document 
A/60/846/Add.4, other mandated reports, such as the United Nations financial 
statements and reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the United 
Nations Board of External Auditors will continue to be provided. Feedback from 
Member States will play a critical role in validating and redefining the proposal.
