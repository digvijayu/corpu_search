  Second report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and 
Budgetary Questions on the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2012-2013 
 
 

 I. Introduction 
 
 

1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has 
considered the following reports relating to information and communications 
technology: 

 (a) Third progress report on the enterprise resource planning project 
(A/66/381); 

 (b) Enterprise information and communications technology initiatives for the 
United Nations Secretariat (A/66/94). 

2. During its consideration of the reports, the Advisory Committee met with the 
Deputy Secretary-General and other representatives of the Secretary-General, who 
provided additional information and clarification. The Committee was also provided 
with substantial additional information in response to its queries, which, where 
relevant, has been reflected in the paragraphs below. 
 
 

 II. Enterprise resource planning project 
 
 

3. The third progress report (A/66/381) of the Secretary-General was submitted 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution 64/243, in which the Assembly requested 
the Secretary-General to continue to ensure that the Assembly is kept informed, on 
an annual basis, of the progress regarding the enterprise resource planning project 
(Umoja).  



A/66/7/Add.1

4. The report of the Secretary-General provides information on the status of the 
project, the activities accomplished during the reporting period (1 August 2010- 
31 August 2011) and proposals for the future direction of the project. A major 
setback is the anticipated two-year delay in the full implementation of Umoja, 
which is now projected for the end of 2015 instead of 2013. In his report, the 
Secretary-General puts forward measures intended to mitigate the effects of the 
delay, in particular, changes to governance and project oversight and a phased 
implementation approach. He indicates that, given the critical dependency of the 
adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) on the 
timely implementation of the enterprise resource planning system, the first phase, 
Umoja Foundation, will include functionality to support IPSAS requirements. 
Umoja Foundation is planned to be piloted in January 2013 and deployed in clusters 
across the Organization by December 2014, in time for the transition to IPSAS. The 
second phase, Umoja Extension, is planned to be deployed by December 2015, and 
will deliver the remaining functions, including human resources management and 
budget formulation.  

5. As regards project governance, the Advisory Committee was informed that the 
Umoja Steering Committee was being chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General on 
an ad interim basis following the resignation of the Under-Secretary-General for 
Management on 16 June 2011. It notes that the membership of the Steering 
Committee has been expanded to include the Chef de Cabinet, as well as the Office 
of Legal Affairs and the Office of Internal Oversight Services in observer capacity. 
As indicated in the report, the Management Committee has also increased its 
monitoring of project progress, especially with regard to the interdependencies with 
the IPSAS implementation project. The Secretary-General states that, to mitigate 
risks of further delay, he is implementing streamlined procedures to expedite 
recruitment and developing contingency plans for managing risks, should certain 
critical functions not be completed in time for IPSAS adoption in 2014 (see also 
A/66/536). The Secretary-General affirms that the revised approach is consistent 
with the “pilot first” implementation endorsed by the General Assembly in 
paragraph 113 of its resolution 64/243 and will deliver the comprehensive 
functionality for driving management reform and organizational transformation as 
originally envisioned. He also states that the overall approved resource requirements 
for project implementation remain unchanged, at $315.8 million. 

6. The Advisory Committee was informed at the time of its review of the 
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013 that the Secretariat was 
anticipating delays in the implementation of the enterprise resource planning 
project. It was also informed at that time that the project had been without a 
Director since June 2011, and furthermore that the Under-Secretary-General for 
Management had resigned as Chair of the Umoja Steering Committee. In its first 
report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013, the 
Advisory Committee expressed disappointment and provided preliminary comments 
on the status of the project (A/66/7, paras. 123-125 and VIII.7-13). The Committee 
commented further on this issue in the context of its consideration of the Secretary-
General’s fourth progress report on adoption of IPSAS (see A/66/536).  

7. In paragraph 8 of his current progress report (A/66/381), the Secretary-General 
elaborates on the factors causing the delay in the implementation of the Umoja 
project. He indicates that more time was required than originally planned for 
procuring the enterprise resource planning software; analysing current operations in 



 A/66/7/Add.1

order to transition to the future operating model; completing the design phase; and 
gaining acceptance of the system by the business process owners and end-users. The 
cultural and institutional changes required to move to the new operating model are 
also reported to have proven more complex and challenging than anticipated. Other 
difficulties cited by the Secretary-General include the time-consuming process for 
the recruitment of the project team members and subject matter experts despite the 
implementation of measures to expedite recruitment, as well as the securing of 
independent consultants with the appropriate expertise. He also states that the 
capacity of the design team was constrained by the limited availability of specialist 
knowledge of new enterprise resource planning software.  

8. While recognizing the challenges posed by the complexity, scale and scope 
of the project, the Advisory Committee considers that the anticipated two-year 
delay in its completion clearly reflects a failure in management of the project. 
The Committee regrets that the Secretary-General did not provide information 
earlier to the General Assembly as to the serious problems affecting the 
implementation of the project. It is deeply disturbed and dismayed by the 
apparent lack of awareness and foreknowledge in the Organization as to the 
actual status of the project, which, in its view, points to the inadequacy of the 
project governance, oversight and reporting arrangements. The Committee is 
also concerned that the concurrent departure of the Director of the project and 
the resignation of the Chair of the Steering Committee in June 2011 left the 
project without leadership and with a weakened management structure at a 
critical juncture, when the project was experiencing significant delays. 

9. Furthermore, in the Advisory’s Committee’s view, many of the factors 
identified by the Secretary-General as the causes of the delay, such as the 
length of time required for recruitment, constitute well-known areas of risk and 
vulnerability, which could have been foreseen and avoided through proper 
project planning and prompt management action. In light of the strategic 
importance of the project and the potential impact of any delay in terms of cost 
escalation, as well as on the planned transition to IPSAS in 2014, the 
Committee regrets in particular that closer attention was not paid to 
anticipating and resolving such project management issues promptly and to 
ensuring that the project structures were functioning properly. In this 
connection, the Advisory Committee also emphasizes the important role of the 
project Steering Committee in guiding implementation of the project, 
supporting the Director of the project in securing the necessary resources, and 
facilitating decision-making and rapid resolution of issues. It also points out 
that the composition and membership of the Steering Committee was designed 
precisely to ensure that the key stakeholders were represented at a sufficient 
level of authority to take relevant decisions. The Advisory Committee is 
therefore disappointed that, despite the representation of senior managers on 
the Umoja Steering Committee, the project continued to face difficulties in 
areas such as the recruitment of staff, the release of subject matter experts and 
in gaining acceptance of the system by users and business process owners.  

10. The Advisory Committee also considers that the Secretary-General’s 
analysis of the factors causing the delay is incomplete. It is of the view that he 
should also have reviewed the impact of factors such as the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the project’s governance, decision-making and risk 
management structures, as well as of the level of cooperation and coordination 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 4 
 

throughout the Secretariat. The Committee notes that the Secretary-General 
makes no attempt to attribute responsibility for the action, or lack thereof, 
leading to the delay, or to hold anyone to account for this situation. 

11. The Advisory Committee recognizes nonetheless the efforts made to 
address the delay and plans to accelerate the process, including the 
development of a revised implementation approach and the efforts aimed at 
strengthening the composition, leadership and role of the project Steering 
Committee, as well as enhancing oversight mechanisms. The Committee 
believes that, at this stage, all efforts must be directed towards ensuring that 
the project is firmly back on track, with a fully staffed team, and that all 
activities are delivered according to plan. It is also necessary that Member 
States have confidence that their investment is protected and are provided 
assurances that the project will be delivered in accordance with the revised 
timeline and within the approved budget. The Committee strongly believes that 
in order for such assurances to be credible, it is essential to demonstrate that 
lessons are fully analysed and effectively applied to ensure that the same 
mistakes are not repeated. To that end, the Committee recommends that the 
Secretary-General be requested to conduct a thorough internal review of the 
factors contributing to the delay in the project and to adjust operational 
controls accordingly and report thereon to the General Assembly in the next 
progress report.  

12. With respect to the revised implementation approach, while the Advisory 
Committee accepts the Secretary-General’s focus on the implementation of 
IPSAS in the first phase, it reiterates that Umoja is a key enabler underpinning 
the Organization’s management reform agenda. It emphasizes that the 
significant investment made by Member States was justified, in part, on the 
basis of management improvements and reforms that Umoja would enable, 
including results-based management, risk management, a strengthened internal 
control framework and enhanced performance and accountability, as well as 
the enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in programme management that the 
system would allow. The Committee reiterates that these improvements remain 
essential organizational goals that must be achieved within the budget 
approved for the project (see also A/66/7, para. 125).  

13. The Advisory Committee recognizes the challenges facing the 
Organization as it embarks on the simultaneous implementation of multiple 
major initiatives over a short period of time, including Umoja and IPSAS, 
which entail significant changes in working methods and will impact large 
numbers of staff across United Nations duty stations worldwide. It emphasizes 
that close cooperation and coordination is required at all levels of the 
Secretariat in order to meet organizational goals and ensure a successful 
outcome.  

14. In addition to the information on governance arrangements and the revised 
implementation approach, the report of the Secretary-General provides an update on 
progress made during the reporting period as regards the design phase and 
reengineering of business processes; the analysis and inventory of the existing 
systems to be replaced or interfaced to Umoja; the analysis of requirements in terms 
of customizations and extensions to the enterprise resource planning software; 
technical activities for implementation of enterprise resource planning 



 A/66/7/Add.1

infrastructure; change management; and benefits realization. It also provides 
information on collaboration initiated with other United Nations entities, in 
particular the World Food Programme, and on opportunities for the realization of 
additional benefits through an alternative service delivery model. 
 
 

 A. Governance and accountability 
 
 

15. The Advisory Committee notes that, at the time of its consideration of the third 
progress report, in October 2011, the Umoja Director post had yet to be filled. 
However, the Committee was informed that the Director was expected to be 
recruited by November 2011. The Advisory Committee considers that the post of 
Umoja Director is crucial for ensuring the effective direction, planning and 
day-to-day management of the project, particularly at a time when major 
changes are occurring and important decisions on the direction of the project 
are being taken. It therefore urges the Secretary-General to ensure that the new 
Project Director is recruited without any further delay.  

16. In paragraphs 11 to 15 of his report, the Secretary-General describes the 
changes made to the Umoja governance structure following the resignation of the 
Under-Secretary-General for Management as Chair of the Umoja Steering 
Committee (see also para. 5 above). The chart in annex I to the report shows the 
modified governance model of the project. The key changes instituted include the 
following: 

 (a) The Steering Committee is chaired ad interim by the Deputy Secretary-
General and its membership has been expanded to include the Chef de Cabinet; 

 (b) The Office of Legal Affairs and the Office of Internal Oversight Services 
are included in the Steering Committee in an observer capacity; 

 (c) The Management Committee has increased its monitoring of project 
progress, in particular with regard to the interdependencies with IPSAS; 

 (d) The Chief Information Technology Officer will guide the management of 
the project on behalf of the Steering Committee; 

 (e) A Business Owners Advisory Group will progressively replace the 
Process Owners Advisory Group as the project evolves from the design to the build 
and deployment phases; 

 (f) A Change Advisory Board has been established to monitor, control and 
document project changes. 

17. From the figure in annex I to the report of the Secretary-General, the Advisory 
Committee notes that the Director of the project now reports to the Chief 
Information Technology Officer only. Under the previous governance model, which 
was last updated and reflected in annex III to the second progress report (A/65/389), 
the Director had two reporting officers: the Chair of the project Steering Committee 
on business processes and the Chief Information Technology Officer on day-to-day 
project management and technology issues. 

18. The Advisory Committee enquired as to the expected duration of the interim 
governance arrangements and whether the Secretary-General intended to present a 
proposal in this regard for consideration by the General Assembly. It was informed 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 6 
 

that once the new Director was on board, the Secretary-General would make a 
decision regarding the governance structure of the project in close consultation with 
the members of the Umoja Steering Committee and the Management Committee. An 
update on the project governance structure would be provided in the next annual 
progress report.  

19. In his report, the Secretary-General states that the Umoja governance structure 
will ensure full accountability and clear lines of responsibility. Upon enquiry, the 
Advisory Committee was informed that Umoja remained a business project driven by 
business process demands, for which all Steering Committee members were 
collectively accountable. While acknowledging the interim measures put into 
place to improve monitoring and oversight of the project (A/66/381, 
paras. 11-15), the Committee believes that much remains to be done to foster a 
culture of accountability and commitment to the project. The Advisory Committee 
was informed by the Deputy Secretary-General that the Steering Committee was fully 
committed to putting Umoja back on the path to success, and that its members were 
prepared to take extraordinary measures to support the project within their areas of 
responsibility. The Advisory Committee welcomes the commitment to the project 
proffered by the Umoja Steering Committee and expects that the members of the 
Committee will assume fully their responsibilities under the leadership of the 
Deputy Secretary-General (see also para. 5 above). The Committee recommends 
that the Secretary-General be requested to provide a permanent governance 
structure for the project as a matter of priority, no later than at the first part of 
the resumed sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, including information 
on the responsibilities of the various actors involved in the governance of the 
project and the mechanisms for ensuring effective accountability. 
 
 

 B. Revised implementation approach, timeline and current status 
 
 

20. As indicated in paragraph 4 above, the Umoja implementation approach has 
been revised in order to mitigate the effects of the delay and accelerate progress, 
while giving priority to implementation of IPSAS by 2014. Under the revised 
approach, the enterprise resource planning system is to be deployed in two phases — 
Umoja Foundation and Umoja Extension. Details on the functions and scope of each 
phase are provided in paragraphs 40 to 47 of the report of the Secretary-General. A 
detailed timeline of the revised implementation plan is also provided in annex II to 
the report. The Advisory Committee notes that to date 317 business processes have 
been developed reflecting the requirements of the Organization, of which a total of 
119 will be provided under Umoja Foundation and the remaining 198 under Umoja 
Extension. The Committee was provided with a table showing the processes to be 
included under each phase by functional group (see annex I). The Committee was 
also informed that the number of processes may evolve during the build phase as a 
result of the consolidation of processes or the business requirements of the 
Organization. However, a tight change control mechanism had been instituted in the 
form of the Change Advisory Board to ensure that any new requirements would be 
contained within the original scope of Umoja. 

21. The functions and timeline of each phase can be summarized as follows: 

 (a) Umoja Foundation will provide the functions required to support the 
transition to IPSAS, including financial management and administrative controls; 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

7 11-60207 
 

certain central support services, such as sales and distribution, travel management 
and real estate management; and supply chain procurement logistics. The pilot will 
commence in January 2013 and be deployed in five successive clusters across the 
Organization by December 2014. As shown in annex I to the present report, the 119 
processes of Umoja Foundation to be deployed comprise 68 finance, 13 central 
support services, 35 supply chain procurement logistics and 3 programme and 
project management processes. The Committee notes that certain existing systems, 
such as Galileo, will be temporarily retained and interfaced to Umoja Foundation to 
provide inventory management functions until the full functionality is provided in 
Umoja. It is indicated in footnote 9 of the report that it will be possible to ensure 
IPSAS requirements through a combination of enterprise resource planning 
software, legacy systems and manual workarounds; 

 (b) Umoja Extension will deliver the remaining functions aimed at 
enhancing planning and resource management, including: human resources 
management; budget formulation; force planning, demand planning and logistics 
execution; conference and events management; documents production and 
distribution; grants management; and sales and services to the public. The 198 
additional processes to be provided under Umoja Extension comprise 61 human 
resources management, 56 finance, 33 central support services, 35 supply chain 
procurement logistics and 13 programme and project management processes. The 
human resources and budget formulation functions will be designed and built at the 
same time as Umoja Foundation, but will commence deployment in 2014. The 
design phase for the rest of Umoja Extension will recommence in 2013 and move 
into the build phase in 2014, with deployment planned for completion by the end of 
2015.  

22. The Secretary-General indicates in paragraph 18 of his report that during the 
reporting period the project team focused on the finalization of the documentation, 
prototyping and refinement of the design of the processes in the areas of finance, 
human resources, central support services, supply chain procurement logistics, and 
programme and project management. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was 
informed that the final design was complete for all the processes relating to Umoja 
Foundation, as well as the human resources management processes to be 
implemented in the Umoja Extension phase. The final design of Umoja Extension 
was planned to commence in mid-2013, at which point minor adjustments to the 
remaining processes would be made, if required.  

23. The Secretary-General further indicates in paragraph 40 of his report that the 
criteria for the selection and timing of deployment sites for each cluster will be 
guided by training needs, volume of transaction and business readiness of each 
location. The Advisory Committee was informed that the selection of the 
missions/organizational units to be included in each cluster would be based on the 
geographical proximity of the sites, the alignment of their time zones and the size 
and complexity of the sites, and would aim to achieve economies of scale in 
predeployment, training and post-implementation support activities. The 
recommended locations for the pilot site were the United Nations Interim Force in 
Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia 
(ESCWA) because of their close geographical proximity in Lebanon. Furthermore, 
UNIFIL was considered to be suitable for pilot testing because it was a moderate- 
sized peacekeeping mission with a well-established technical infrastructure, and also 
served as a regional information technology hub and training centre. The pilot 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 8 
 

would also include the Field Procurement Section of the Procurement Division, 
which manages Headquarters-based contracting for common commodities and 
services via systems contracts and provides essential services for UNIFIL and 
ESCWA operations.  

24. The Advisory Committee was also informed that in order to complete the 
necessary tests and preparatory activities, the enterprise resource planning software 
and infrastructure would have to be installed at the enterprise data centres at 
Brindisi, Italy, and Valencia, Spain, six months prior to deployment of the pilot in 
January 2013. Discussions on this issue were currently under way between the 
Umoja project team, the Office of Information and Communications Technology, 
and the Department of Field Support. 

25. In paragraphs 58 and 59 of the report, the Secretary-General provides 
information on opportunities for consolidating administrative functions and services 
and achieving greater economies of scale through alternative service delivery 
approaches. He indicates that the next progress report will provide information on 
the outcome of an assessment of the current operating environment, including 
potential benefits and areas of improvement, as well as a detailed business case and 
implementation plan. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 59 of the 
report that any service delivery model adopted at the United Nations must be able to 
support the model for delivering field support. The Committee looks forward to 
receiving the Secretary-General’s proposals for improved and cost-effective 
service delivery approaches. It trusts that any new approaches proposed will be 
compatible with the business process model developed for the implementation 
of Umoja.  

26. As regards the temporary retention and adaptation of legacy systems 
to support IPSAS pending availability of full functionality in Umoja (see 
para. 20 (a) above), in its report on the IPSAS implementation project, the 
Advisory Committee cautioned about the need to ensure that the 
implementation of temporary solutions did not divert vital resources away from 
the implementation of Umoja, thereby compounding risks of delays and cost 
escalation in the delivery of Umoja Foundation (A/66/536, para. 16). 
 
 

 C. Procurement 
 
 

27. From the detailed project timeline shown in annex II to the report of the 
Secretary-General, the Advisory Committee notes that procurement is under way of 
the systems integration services for the build and implementation activities of the 
first phase, Umoja Foundation. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the 
Procurement Division had advertised four separate rounds of expressions of interest 
and that the Secretariat was finalizing its statement of work for the build phase. The 
solicitation was to be released in the immediate future and was expected to be 
completed in the first quarter of 2012. In view of the implementation timeline of 
Umoja Foundation and the planned start of the pilot at the beginning of 2013, 
the Advisory Committee urges the Secretary-General to ensure that all the 
necessary steps are taken to secure the services of the systems integrator in a 
timely manner so as to avoid any risks of further delays to the project. 



 A/66/7/Add.1

 D. Recruitment and staffing 
 
 

28. The Secretary-General indicates that despite the implementation of measures 
to expedite recruitment, the hiring of United Nations staff members and subject 
matter experts remains a time-consuming factor causing delays in the project (see 
para. 7 above). The Advisory Committee was informed that, on the basis of the 
current projected requirements for the bienniums 2012-2013 and 2014-2015, it 
would be possible to deliver the project within the approved budget of 
$315.8 million on the condition that all of the 90 project and 66 subject matter 
expert positions were filled by April 2012 (see also paras. 29-35 below). The 
Committee was also informed that as of September 2011, 53 of the 90 Umoja 
project positions and 17 of the 66 subject matter expert positions had been filled 
(see table 1 below). 

29. The Advisory Committee was informed that measures to expedite recruitment 
had been taken following the decisions made by the Steering Committee at its 
meeting on 16 November 2010 (see annex II below). Since July 2011, the Office of 
Human Resources Management had made available additional special measures for 
recruiting Umoja staff, allowing advertisement of job openings for 15 days only and 
without a requirement for review by the central review bodies, on the condition that 
employment of the recruited staff would be limited to service with the Umoja 
project. The Committee was informed that this arrangement was expected to yield 
positive results in terms of accelerating the recruitment process. It was indicated 
that, as of 10 October 2011, the recruitment process was well under way; at the time 
of the Committee’s consideration of the report of the Secretary-General, recruitment 
for 15 vacancies was in process. The Advisory Committee notes the efforts made 
to adapt recruitment procedures in response to the specific circumstances of 
and challenges faced by the Umoja project. In this connection, the Committee 
recalls that in his second progress report, the Secretary-General had stated that 
timely recruitment had been a challenge and had been regarded as a significant 
project risk factor (A/65/389, para. 54). Given that the difficulties in filling 
vacant Umoja positions partly contributed to the delay in the implementation 
of the project, the Committee considers this situation should have been 
addressed in a timely manner. 

30. With respect to the subject matter experts, the Advisory Committee was 
informed that an active outreach programme was in place for identifying the staff 
members required for the project and for gaining the support of the concerned 
departments, offices, and field missions in the release of those staff members when 
needed by the project. 

31. The Advisory Committee was provided with the following table showing the 
Umoja recruitment plan for staff and subject matter experts from September 2011 to 
May 2012:

32. The Advisory Committee notes that timely recruitment of staff and 
subject matter experts represents a critical requirement for the delivery of the 
project within the approved budget and the timeline of the revised 
implementation approach (see para. 28 above). It is therefore of paramount 
importance that the Umoja project positions are filled on time and that the 
required subject matter experts are made available to meet the requirements of 
the timetable of the project. To that end, the Committee recommends that the 
Secretary-General be requested to closely monitor the effectiveness of the 
expedited recruitment procedures and ensure that they are producing the 
desired results. It stresses that immediate action must be taken to address any 
delays in meeting the targets of the Umoja recruitment plan for filling posts 
and subject matter positions (see table 1 above). The Secretary-General should 
also be requested to provide in his next progress report details on the month-to-
month evolution of the status of staffing and any further actions taken to keep 
the process on track. 

33. The Advisory Committee recalls that subject matter experts have an in-depth 
knowledge of their functional areas and the requirements of their 
departments/offices and are needed to assist the Umoja project team on a temporary 
basis in system design, data conversion, interface development, report generation 
and testing of the enterprise resource planning system. They also have a key role to 
play in training and supporting users during deployment and in the post-deployment 
period. The contributions of subject matter experts range from a few hours to 
several months at a time. The positions of the subject matter experts are filled on a 
temporary basis if their continuous absence from their regular functions exceeds 
four weeks. The Committee had previously been informed that without such a 
provision, there was a risk that managers would refuse to release subject matter 
experts (see A/64/7/Add.9, paras. 82 and 83).  

34. The Advisory Committee is concerned that as the duration of the 
implementation period has been increased from 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 years, new 
challenges in recruiting subject matter experts may arise. In particular, it may 
become increasingly burdensome for departments/offices to release their 
subject matter experts to the project for extended periods. The Committee 
urges the Secretary-General to proactively take the necessary steps to ensure 
the continued availability of the expertise provided by subject matter experts 
that is needed by the project. Furthermore, the Committee considers that it is 
in the interest of the contributing departments/offices to provide their most 
knowledgeable staff to support the design and implementation of the 
Organization’s new operating model so as to ensure that it meets their 
requirements, as well as to develop their internal expertise and knowledge of 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

11 11-60207 
 

the new system. The Committee also emphasizes the important role of the 
members of the Umoja Steering Committee in supporting the recruitment of 
the subject matter experts required for the project. The Advisory Committee 
recommends that the Secretary-General be requested to provide details on the 
status of the recruitment of subject matter experts in his next progress report.  

35. The Advisory Committee requested additional information in support of the 
Secretary-General’s statement in paragraph 8 of his report, that the limited 
availability of specialist knowledge of new enterprise resource planning software 
had constrained the capacity of the design team and was one of the causes of the 
delay in the project. It was informed that, to complement specialist knowledge 
provided by the systems integrator, the project relied on specialists retained as 
independent consultants to supplement Umoja staff on an “as-required” basis. 
However, the United Nations had faced competition for scarce specialists with 
others in the market who offered rates that were significantly higher than those of 
the United Nations for individual consultants. The Committee was further informed 
that the project team had used well-known international publications and specialized 
websites for the recruitment of such specialists, but often lost potential candidates to 
competition as a result of the lengthy procedures and long recruitment times. The 
representatives of the Secretary-General also stated that the inability to secure 
specialist consultants when needed would impede progress in the concerned area 
and could also have an adverse impact on overall project delivery and costs. In light 
of the serious risks of cost escalation and delays in the delivery of the project, 
the Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary-General be requested 
to address this issue as a matter of urgency, taking into account all options for 
using expedited procedures for the recruitment of such specialists. He should be 
requested to report on this matter in the context of his next progress report. 
 
 

 E. Change management 
 
 

36. In paragraphs 21 to 27 of his report, the Secretary-General provides an 
overview of the change management activities undertaken during the reporting 
period, which included: efforts to increase staff awareness about the project by 
organizing information sessions and encouraging staff to join Umoja NET, the 
project portal; the organization of senior-level meetings and working group sessions 
on topics such as fixed assets, inventory management and real estate management to 
increase understanding of the interdependencies between IPSAS and Umoja; the 
development of a global learning plan to support end-users, blending traditional 
instructor-led classroom learning and e-learning approaches; and an update on the 
review and acceptance of the new business processes. The Committee notes that 
since the last progress report, 229 of the future “to-be” processes were released for 
acceptance by the business owners, of which 143, or some 50 per cent, have been 
accepted.  

37. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that a comprehensive 
training plan was currently under development. It was envisaged that end-user 
training would be conducted by cluster and business area and would begin six weeks 
before deployment. An estimated 26 per cent of the 40,890 United Nations staff 
members, representing approximately 10,429 end-users, would need to be trained. 
The Committee requested clarification as to the requirement of $4,592,380 proposed 
in paragraph 80 (d) of the report to cover travel costs of Umoja trainers to deliver a 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 12 
 

comprehensive training to end-users in 2012-2013. It was provided with a 
breakdown of costs, which is attached as annex III to the present report. 

38. As indicated in paragraph 13 above, the Organization is undertaking the 
simultaneous implementation of multiple major initiatives, including Umoja and 
IPSAS, all of which entail significant change in working methods and business 
processes. The Advisory Committee emphasizes that close attention should be 
paid to coordinating change management activities related to the 
implementation of Umoja at each location so as to ensure a smooth deployment 
of systems, limit the burden on end-users and avoid disrupting operational 
activities. In this regard, the Committee recalls that in its report on progress in the 
implementation of IPSAS, the Board of Auditors recommended that the Secretariat 
assess the feasibility of combining the business change activities for Umoja and 
IPSAS (A/66/151, para. 52). The Committee shares the Board’s view that some 
of the business change activities for Umoja and IPSAS could potentially be 
combined to bring benefits in terms of costs (for communications, training, 
staff time) and effectiveness and furthermore that change management 
messages would be more powerfully delivered as a joint message and would 
more effectively use senior management time. The Advisory Committee 
recommends that the Secretary-General be requested to provide information in 
his next progress report on the feasibility of combining any of the business 
change activities for Umoja and IPSAS and for achieving cost savings and 
efficiency gains. 
 
 

 F. Existing systems, interfaces, customizations, extensions and 
technical activities 
 
 

39. The Secretary-General provides an update on existing systems, interfaces, 
customizations, extensions and general technical activities in paragraphs 28 to 35 of 
his report. He indicates that the process of analysis and inventory of the systems that 
could be replaced by Umoja continues in close coordination with the Office of 
Information and Communications Technology. As indicated, approximately  
700 systems will be replaced, while up to 300 of the remaining systems may require 
a technical interface to Umoja. The Secretary-General provides some details on the 
interfaces to be established between Umoja and major systems such as Inspira 
(talent management system), Galileo (inventory management in peacekeeping 
missions) and Documentum (document/records management system). He indicates 
that many of the remaining systems could be interfaced to Umoja through a small 
number of common, technical interfaces. The Secretary-General also asserts that no 
essential customization of the core software is required. Furthermore, two 
anticipated major extensions referred to in the previous progress report will not be 
required, namely, a parallel ledger to cope with the United Nations dual budgetary 
cycles and a solution for United Nations requirements in material tracking (see 
A/66/381, para. 32). 

40. In his second progress report, the Secretary-General had indicated that a 
comprehensive cataloguing of existing applications was being carried out in 
cooperation with the Office of Information and Communications Technology and 
the Information and Communications Technology Division of the Department of 
Field Support (A/65/389, footnote 18). The Advisory Committee, in its related 
report had requested the Secretary-General to pursue his analysis and to provide a 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

13 11-60207 
 

comprehensive inventory of all the systems providing core functions for the 
management of human, financial and physical resources, which would also provide 
information on: (a) the systems to be replaced by Umoja, which could be 
decommissioned; (b) the systems to be maintained, which would be interfaced to 
Umoja; and (c) the systems to be maintained for which no interface was required 
(see A/65/576). The Committee has consistently emphasized, since the inception 
of the project, the importance of making such an inventory available, which in 
its view is essential for decision-making and planning of the enterprise resource 
planning project, including for the estimation of costs relating to the 
development of interfaces and cleansing and migration of data (see paras. 53 
and 54 below), as well as for estimating the related costs and resources released 
as a result of the decommissioning of the systems to be replaced by Umoja. The 
Committee considers that there has not been much progress made in this area 
since its consideration of the previous report of the Secretary-General. It 
continues to stress the importance of making progress in this regard and 
reiterates its previous request (see A/65/576, paras. 31 and 32).  
 
 

 G. Collaboration with other United Nations entities 
 
 

41. In paragraphs 54 to 57 of his report,  the Secretary-General provides 
information on collaboration between the Umoja team and the World Food 
Programme (WFP). The Advisory Committee notes that in the first quarter of 2011 a 
“fit-gap analysis” was conducted comparing the WFP enterprise resource planning 
solution, WINGS II,1 to the requirements of the United Nations, with a view to 
determining whether any elements of WINGS II could be incorporated into Umoja 
in order to accelerate progress. The Secretary-General indicates that this exercise 
demonstrated that the United Nations could benefit from WINGS II in the areas of 
finance and human resource management and by replicating WFP documentation 
and training materials. The Umoja team also benefited from the lessons learned by 
WFP, as an early implementer of an enterprise resource planning system, in 
developing the approach for phasing the initial deployment of the system to meet 
IPSAS requirements. The Committee also notes from paragraph 17 of the report that 
the Umoja team worked with representatives of WFP and relevant United Nations 
departments to analyse the rules, regulations and policies that would need updating 
to support the new business processes. The Committee notes that the Umoja team 
will continue to collaborate with WFP in the future and will examine WINGS II 
with a view to identifying further areas for accelerating progress.  

42. The Secretary-General indicates in paragraph 52 of his report that the Umoja 
project team has initiated a study of approximately 25 United Nations organizations 
that have implemented enterprise resource planning systems to identify common 
solutions, procedures and standards across United Nations organizations. It is 
expected that the results of study will provide the Umoja team with information on 
best practices for the build and deploy phases, with a view to lowering the costs of 
Umoja. Upon enquiry the Advisory Committee was provided with some information 
on the initial findings of the study, which is attached as annex IV to the present 
report.

43. The Advisory Committee welcomes the collaboration between the Umoja 
team and its counterpart at WFP. It encourages the Secretary-General to 
pursue such cooperation and collaboration and to draw lessons from the 
experience of WFP. The Committee also notes the Secretary-General’s decision 
to initiate a United Nations system-wide study on enterprise resource planning 
solutions. It looks forward to receiving an update on collaboration activities 
and further information on the findings of the system-wide study in the next 
progress report. The Committee considers that the study should also examine 
the feasibility of convergence towards the adoption of common enterprise 
resource planning solutions among the entities of the United Nations system in 
the long term. It remains convinced that such convergence will be necessary to 
manage costs and maintain sustainable enterprise resource planning solutions 
in the future.  
 
 

 H. Benefits realization 
 
 

44. An update on the expected qualitative and quantitative benefits is provided in 
paragraphs 48 to 50 of the report of the Secretary-General. Qualitative benefits 
include increased operational effectiveness and timeliness, improved accountability, 
adoption of international best practices and standards, enhanced transparency, 
higher client satisfaction and better internal controls across the broad range of 
financial, procurement and staffing processes, as well as improvement in the 
availability and quality of information, reduction in manual effort, and building of 
staff skills. The Secretary-General states that the overall quantitative benefits related 
to Umoja that were identified in the first and second progress reports remain valid. 
Such benefits are estimated in the range of $139 million to $220 million. It is also 
indicated that an analysis of the impact of the revised implementation approach on 
the realization of benefits is under way. 

45. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was provided with updated 
information on the quantitative benefits provided in the first progress report of the 
Secretary-General (A/64/380, annex I) showing a high and a low range of expected 
cost savings by function and business process. The Committee was informed that 
the benefits were examined for feasibility and data accuracy and were categorized 
under the two phases of the revised implementation approach, Umoja Foundation 
and Umoja Extension.  

46. The Advisory Committee recalls that the analysis of quantitative benefits 
provided in the first progress report had included details on productivity and 
efficiency gains underlying the cost savings. For example, productivity gains were 
translated in terms of a high and a low range of savings in staff time, which were 
consolidated as full-time equivalents and converted to financial values using the 
average cost of the full-time equivalents performing those tasks. Estimates for 
savings resulting from efficiency gains such as the decommissioning of systems to 
be replaced by the enterprise resource planning system were established on the basis 
of overall support costs and industry standards. In his first progress report, the 
Secretary-General indicated that the estimates of quantitative benefits, while 
calculated on thorough analysis using a structured methodology, were based on a 
number of assumptions and existing data that was not always complete or fully 
reliable, owing to the limitations of current information systems. The expectation 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

15 11-60207 
 

was that the assumptions would continue to be validated and refined as the detailed 
design phase and reengineering of business processes progressed.  

47. The Advisory Committee is of the view that the analysis of quantitative 
benefits provided in the first progress report facilitated its consideration of the 
report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the enterprise 
resource planning system. It recommends that the Secretary-General be 
requested to continue to include in future progress reports updated information 
similar to that presented in the table contained in annex I to document 
A/64/380, including details on productivity gains and savings in staff time, with 
a view to providing greater transparency in measuring the expected 
quantitative benefits.  
 
 

 I. Status of expenditures and other costs related the implementation 
of the enterprise resource planning 
 
 

48. By its resolution 63/262, the General Assembly authorized the Secretary-
General to establish a multi-year special account to record income and expenditures 
for the enterprise resource planning project. Subsequently, in its resolution 64/243, 
the General Assembly endorsed the proposal of the Secretary-General to deploy the 
enterprise resource planning project through the “pilot first” option. The resource 
requirements to implement the pilot first option through full deployment were 
estimated at $315,792,300.  

49. In paragraphs 66 to 75 of his report, the Secretary-General provides details on 
the status of resources approved for and utilized by the project during the bienniums 
2008-2009 and 2010-2011. Table 3 of the report provides a summary of the amounts 
approved and expenditures by biennium. The Advisory Committee notes that a total 
amount of $195,348,200 has been approved by the General Assembly thus far, 
comprising $20,000,000 in 2008-2009 and $175,348,200 in 2010-2011. Actual 
expenditures amounted to $17,699,700 in 2008-2009 and are projected at 
$103,635,800 during the current biennium. Total expenditures since the project was 
approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 63/262 are estimated at 
$121,335,500, reflecting an underexpenditure of $74,012,700 as compared to the 
amount approved.  

50. As indicated in the preceding paragraphs, the Secretary-General states that the 
overall level of resources required for the implementation of Umoja in two phases 
remains unchanged at $315,792,300. Table 5 of the report shows the estimated 
implementation costs of Umoja Foundation (phase 1) and Umoja Extension (phase 
2) by year, from 2012 to 2015, as well as the total projected expenditures for the 
2008-2011 period.  

51. The Advisory Committee sought additional information on financial 
implications of the delay and the revised implementation approach and clarification 
as to how Umoja would be delivered within the approved budget of $315,792,300. It 
was informed that the two-year extension of the implementation period would entail 
additional overhead costs during that period to cover staff salaries and entitlements 
and general operating expenses for rent, communications, office automation 
equipment, supplies and materials. However, every effort would be made to 
minimize these costs by reducing the size of the team gradually over time as an 
increasing number of individual components of the enterprise resource planning 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 16 
 

system were completed and deployed. The Committee was further informed that the 
requirements for the deployment of the complete system within the approved budget 
had been projected until the end of the biennium 2014-2015.  

52. The Advisory Committee was informed that it had been determined that the 
project costs could be contained within the approved budget, subject to the 
assumptions that: the 90 project posts and 66 subject matter expert positions would 
be filled by April 2012; the required subject matter experts would be released by 
their respective departments/offices and made available to the project when 
required; the systems integrator for the build phase would have an onshore and 
offshore ratio of 30:70 (this assumption impacts multiple objects of expenditure, 
including requirements for contractual services and general operating expenses to 
cover requirements for office facilities); United Nations staff would acquire greater 
enterprise resource planning technical expertise during the first phase and be able to 
assume a greater role in the second phase of implementation, thereby reducing the 
requirement for costly specialists; the user community would commit to 
participating in onsite preparatory activities such as data cleansing, user testing, and 
user training (see para. 53 below); and maintenance costs would be borne by the 
user community from 2014 onwards. 

53. Upon enquiry as to the expected involvement of the user community referred 
to in paragraph 52 above, the Advisory Committee was informed that the project 
team was conducting an analysis of the total cost of ownership2 of the Umoja 
project. The study would include a complete costing of items funded from the 
Umoja project budget, as well as costs that are to be borne by United Nations 
departments/offices. The representatives of the Secretary-General stated that such a 
study reflected a best practice for large enterprise resource planning and information 
and communications technology projects in which the majority of development 
costs are borne by the central project, but costs for related activities, such as the 
cleansing of data to be migrated to the enterprise resource planning system, are 
supported by the user departments that own the data and must perform those 
activities as part of their operational responsibilities. The Committee was also 
informed that the study was expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter 
of 2012. Further details on the composition of the costs to be supported by user 
departments were provided to the Committee (see annex V). In this connection, the 
Committee recalls that in its previous report it had also requested the Secretary-
General to provide estimates of future operating costs (see A/64/7/Add.9, para. 87 
and A/65/576, para. 37). 

54. The Advisory Committee was further informed that the Umoja budget covered 
costs associated with data conversions and interfaces of applications categorized as 
“priority systems”. These included, inter alia, data conversion of all instances of 
IMIS, procurement systems and the enterprise systems of the Department of Field 
Support (inter alia, SUN, Mercury, Progen, Nucleus and the Field Personnel 
Management System), as well as the interfaces to be developed between Umoja and 
other major systems, such as Inspira, the iNeed customer relationship management 
system and the corporate telephone billing systems. The Committee was further 

__________________ 

 2  Includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the acquisition and operation of a computer 
system over its entire life cycle, including capital investment, hardware and software, plus 
indirect costs of installation, training and technical support, as well as future costs for 
operations and upgrading of the system. 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

17 11-60207 
 

informed that the costs associated with archiving and decommissioning priority 
legacy systems were not included under the Umoja budget, but would be assumed 
by the owners of those systems. The representatives of the Secretary-General 
indicated that many of the other systems to be replaced were relatively small and 
would not require data conversions. Upon enquiry the Committee was also informed 
that the deferral of the realization of benefits until after the deployment and 
stabilization of Umoja Foundation and Umoja Extension represented an opportunity 
cost for the Organization.  

55. The Advisory Committee notes the information provided on the costs 
related to the implementation of the enterprise resource planning system. It 
considers that there is an urgent need to: identify precisely and 
comprehensively all the tasks required for the implementation of the enterprise 
resource planning system; determine the resources required for the 
accomplishment of those tasks; establish clearly the costs to be covered under 
the Umoja budget and those to be absorbed by the concerned departments; and 
assign responsibility for the completion of the tasks in accordance with the 
schedule of implementation of Umoja (see also para. 40 above). The Committee 
recommends that the Secretary-General be requested to complete the analysis 
of the total cost of ownership of Umoja as a matter of priority and to report 
thereon to the General Assembly at the second part of its resumed sixty-sixth 
session. 
 
 

 J. Resource requirements for 2012-2013 
 
 

56. The estimated resource requirements for the Umoja project for the biennium 
2012-2013 are set out in paragraphs 77 to 80 of the report. The total cost for the 
biennium 2012-2013 is estimated at $117,373,500 comprising: 

 (a) $30,864,100 under posts, to provide for salary and common staff costs 
for the continuation of 90 posts for the Umoja project team (1 D-2, 8 D-1, 21 P-5, 
37 P-4, 9 P-3, 1 P-2, 1 General Service (Principal level) and 12 General Service 
(Other level);  

 (b) $17,792,700 under other staff costs, to cover requirements for general 
temporary assistance to provide for 66 subject matter experts;  

 (c) $3,484,800 under consultants and experts to provide for fees 
($3,196,800) and travel costs ($288,000) based on an estimate of 288 work months 
of specialized expertise; 

 (d) $8,651,900 under travel of staff, to cover requirements for the travel of 
Umoja staff to complete the build and deployment of Umoja Foundation in the pilot 
location and the subsequent clusters, including a provision of $4,592,380 to cover 
travel costs of the Umoja trainers who will deliver a comprehensive training to end-
users in the biennium 2012-2013; 

 (e) $34,625,800 under contractual services, largely to cover the requirements 
for system integrator services ($30,140,600) commencing in early 2012 to build, test 
and deploy Umoja Foundation, as well as for legal and strategic consulting, training 
of Umoja staff, including subject matter experts, on enterprise resource planning 
software, training of trainers and user training for the deployment of Umoja 
Foundation;  



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 18 
 

 (f) $5,164,700 under general operating expenses, to provide for rental of 
premises, maintenance and support of the local area network technical infrastructure 
and central servers for support of Umoja and rental and maintenance of office 
automation equipment;  

 (g) $290,400 under supplies and materials, to provide for stationery and 
office supplies, including $104,600 for Umoja training materials;  

 (h) $16,499,100 under furniture and equipment, for the acquisition of 
software licences, furniture and equipment.  

57. Explanations of the variances between the proposals for 2012-2013 as 
compared to 2010-2011 under individual objects of expenditure are provided in 
paragraph 78 of the report. The Committee notes that the differences are mainly due 
to the revised phased implementation approach. 
 
 

 K. Conclusion and recommendation 
 
 

58. The proposals for action to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in 
paragraph 85 of the Secretary-General’s report. The Advisory Committee 
recommends that the General Assembly:  

 (a) Take note of the Secretary-General’s third progress report on the 
implementation of the Umoja project taking into account the views and 
recommendations in the present report, in particular the recommendation in 
paragraph 19 above that the Secretary-General provide a permanent 
governance structure for the Umoja project no later than at the first part of the 
resumed sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly; 

 (b) Authorize the Secretary-General to enter into commitments in a total 
amount not to exceed $17,806,300 (net), as presented under section 29A, Office 
of the Under-Secretary-General for Management, of the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 2012-2013, representing the regular budget share for 
the Umoja project (A/66/6 (Sect. 29A) and Corr.1);  

 (c) Note that the requirements for the biennium 2014-2015 in the 
amount of $13,269,700 (net) will be included in the proposed programme 
budget under section 29A, Office of the Under-Secretary-General for 
Management, representing the regular budget share for the Umoja project;  

 (d) Note that the future remaining requirements in the estimated amount 
of $56,006,500 (net) will be included in the subsequent requirements for the 
support account for peacekeeping operations for the financial periods 
beginning from 1 July 2012. 
 
 

 III. Enterprise information and communications technology 
initiatives for the United Nations Secretariat  
 
 

59. The Advisory Committee initially considered the report of the Secretary-
General on enterprise information and communications technology (ICT) initiatives 
(A/66/94) in conjunction with his proposals under section 30, Office of Information 
and Communications Technology, of the proposed programme budget for the 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

19 11-60207 
 

biennium 2012-2013. Just as it was finalizing its report, the Committee was 
informed that the Secretariat was anticipating delays in the implementation of the 
enterprise resource planning project and that the Secretary-General would propose 
measures to mitigate delays in the context of his next progress report, including a 
revised approach for delivering the project in phases, focusing initially on the 
functions needed to support the adoption of the International Public Sector 
Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The Advisory Committee decided to defer the 
issuance of its report and to revisit the Secretary-General’s proposals for enterprise 
ICT initiatives until further information on the revised approach for the 
implementation of Umoja became available. In making its observations and 
recommendations below, the Committee bore in mind the challenges facing the 
Organization as it concurrently undertakes multiple major, high-risk and costly 
initiatives, which must be implemented within tight time frames. 

60. Background to the report of the Secretary-General is given in paragraphs 1 to 3 
of the report. As indicated, by its resolution 63/262, the General Assembly endorsed 
the overall approach relating to the ICT strategy for the Secretariat and decided to 
establish, effective 1 January 2009, the Office of Information and Communications 
Technology, as a central organizational unit to provide strong leadership for the 
development and implementation of Organization-wide ICT programmes that 
effectively support the Secretariat’s mission and its global operations. As one of the 
first steps in the implementation of the ICT strategy, the Office of Information and 
Communications Technology conducted a structural review of all ICT units 
Secretariat-wide and established a comprehensive inventory of ICT capacities across 
the Organization (A/65/491, paras. 82-103). The key findings of the review were 
that the ICT environment and processes of the Organization remained highly 
decentralized, fragmented, duplicatory and non-standardized, thereby driving up the 
costs of operations and preventing the Organization from realizing economies of 
scale. Furthermore, a large proportion of resources were directed towards 
infrastructure and routine operational tasks, and ICT support for programmatic, 
substantive, administrative and managerial activities was lacking. The review 
highlighted that annual ICT expenditures of the United Nations were estimated at 
$774 million, including from regular budget, peacekeeping and support account and 
extrabudgetary funding sources. In the same report, the Secretary-General also 
highlighted the difficulties encountered in determining a consolidated budget figure: 
because of the lack of consistent and comparable data across the Organization, the 
overall estimate was based on a time-consuming manual compilation of information 
from a variety of documents, making it difficult to track the costs of ICT activities 
on a regular basis. 

61. On the basis of the findings of the review, in his progress report on the 
implementation of the ICT strategy (A/65/491) the Secretary-General proposed four 
structural review projects aimed at streamlining and standardizing the ICT 
environments across the Secretariat: (a) globalize service desks; (b) streamline data 
centres; (c) rationalize ICT organization; and (d) strengthen the Office of 
Information and Communications Technology. The overall resources proposed for 
the four projects over a five-year implementation period from 2011 to 2015 
amounted to $140.7 million ($8.5 million for the biennium 2010-2011, $50.7 million 
for 2012-2013 and $81.4 million for 2014-2015) and involved the establishment of a 
total of 51 posts under the regular budget, of which 23 were proposed to be 
established in 2011 and a further 28 in the biennium 2012-2013. The structural 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 20 
 

review projects were proposed to be funded on the basis of the cost-sharing 
arrangement approved for the enterprise resource planning project, Umoja.3 

62. In its resolution 65/259 on the above proposals, the General Assembly 
endorsed the related report of the Advisory Committee (A/65/575). It authorized the 
Secretary-General to proceed with structural review project 3, Rationalize ICT 
organization, and decided that the $1.5 million required for the project for 2011 
would be provided from within the resources approved for the biennium 2010-2011. 
The Assembly also decided to provide general temporary assistance equivalent to 
seven P-4 positions for structural review project 4, Strengthen the Office of 
Information and Communications Technology, of which five were to be funded from 
within existing resources for 2010-2011. The Assembly did not support structural 
review project 1, Globalize service desks, or structural review project 2, Streamline 
data centres. It requested the Secretary-General to review the proposals on the 
implementation of the ICT strategy contained in his report (A/65/491), and to 
submit new and/or revised proposals in the context of the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 2012-2013. The current report of the Secretary-General 
(A/66/94) is submitted in response to that request. The report also responds to 
previous requests by the General Assembly in its resolutions 63/262, 63/269 and 
64/243 concerning the implementation of the solutions for enterprise content 
management and customer relationship management and the development of a 
unified disaster recovery and business continuity plan. 

63. In his report (A/66/94), the Secretary-General presents four revised cross-
cutting, Organization-wide initiatives as follows: 

 (a) Improve enterprise ICT management, integrating earlier proposals for 
structural review project 3, Rationalize the ICT organization, and structural review 
project 4, Strengthen the Office of Information and Communications Technology;  

 (b) Leverage knowledge through ICT, formerly referred to as enterprise 
content management, which responds to the General Assembly’s request for a fully 
justified proposal for the implementation of enterprise content management in the 
context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013 (resolution 
64/243, para. 126); 

 (c) Enhance ICT service delivery, revising the Secretary-General’s previous 
proposal for structural review project 1, Globalize service desks (see A/65/491) and 
integrating ongoing implementation of the customer relationship management 
system. This initiative also responds to the General Assembly’s request for a fully 
justified proposal for the implementation of customer relationship management in 
the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013 (ibid.); 

 (d) Create a resilient ICT infrastructure, presenting a revised proposal for 
structural review project 2, Streamline data centres (see A/65/491), which 
incorporates, in response to General Assembly resolutions 63/262, 63/269 and 
65/259, the requirements for a unified disaster recovery and business continuity 
plan, including a permanent solution for Headquarters.  

64. Figure 1 of the report illustrates the linkages between previous General 
Assembly resolutions and the four enterprise ICT initiatives being proposed. For

each initiative, the report provides details on the background of the proposal; the 
objectives to be achieved; the implementation approach, including key activities, 
phases and a timetable; progress made in related areas since the establishment of the 
Office of Information and Communications Technology on 1 January 2009; resource 
requirements proposed for implementation of activities during the biennium 2012-
2013; and preliminary estimates of requirements for 2014-2015. The Secretary-
General also provides information on the qualitative and quantitative benefits 
expected from the implementation of each initiative. Annex IV to the report contains 
a quantitative benefit analysis for each initiative.  

65. The Secretary-General states that, taken together, these four initiatives would 
address critical institutional ICT needs and improve the effective and efficient 
delivery of the Secretariat’s ICT programmes. They would also allow the 
Organization to move from a decentralized to a federated model, in line with the 
ICT strategy adopted by the General Assembly. Under that model, the Office of 
Information and Communications Technology is responsible for setting 
Organization-wide strategy, standards and policies, providing enterprise systems and 
infrastructure, and planning and coordinating Secretariat-wide ICT activities, while 
decentralized, independent ICT units in departments/offices deal with local and 
operational issues and provide departmental systems and services as required, based 
on organizational standards. The Secretary-General further indicates that, should the 
initiatives not be implemented, or only partially implemented, it will be difficult to 
overcome the challenges arising from the continued fragmentation of ICT capacities 
and resources across the Organization, including the high cost of ICT operations.  

66. The Secretary-General states that by addressing the fragmentation of the 
current ICT environment of the United Nations, the implementation of the four 
initiatives would create an optimal environment for the effective implementation 
and operation of ICT systems, including enterprise systems, in particular through 
the establishment of suitable ICT policies and organizational structures, technical 
architecture and standards, end-user technical services, communications and 
infrastructure. 

67. The Secretary-General proposes that the four initiatives be carried out over a 
four-year period from 2012 to 2015 and that they be funded on the basis of the cost-
sharing arrangement approved for Umoja (see para. 61 above). A summary of the 
total costs for the implementation of the four initiatives for the biennium 2012-2013 
is provided in section III of the report of the Secretary-General (A/66/94,  
paras. 150 and 151). The overall resources proposed for 2012-2013 amount to 
$42,822,500, comprising $6,423,400 to be funded from the regular budget, 
$26,550,000 from the support account for peacekeeping operations over the 
2011/12, 2012/13 and 2013/14 financial periods, and $9,949,100 in extrabudgetary 
resources from the special accounts for programme support costs. Estimated 
requirements for the biennium 2014-2015 and beyond range from $37 to  
$54 million.  

68. The Secretary-General states that, in response to the General Assembly’s 
request, the proposals presented in previous reports were reviewed and revised with 
the goal of presenting an integrated set of new proposals and achieving a similar 
impact at a significantly reduced cost by leveraging existing efforts and 
technological tools across the Organization. The Advisory Committee notes that the 
proposed initiatives were developed in consultation and collaboration with 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 22 
 

departments and offices through the ICT governance mechanisms in place and that 
they are to be deployed through a joint effort of the Office of Information and 
Communications Technology and other organizational units (see A/66/94, para. 7).  

69. The Advisory Committee was informed that the $42.8 million proposed for the 
four initiatives for the biennium 2012-2013 reflected a 33 per cent reduction as 
compared to combined resource requirements of $64 million for the previous 
proposals contained in documents A/65/491 and A/62/510/Rev.1. The Committee 
was provided with summary information on the differences and cost comparisons 
between the current and previous proposals, which are attached as annexes VI and 
VII below. An overview of the key activities undertaken in the area of each initiative 
and progress made since 2009 is provided in annex VIII below. 

70. In its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-
2013, the Advisory Committee noted that the regular budget share of the resources 
proposed for the four initiatives was not reflected under budgetary proposals for 
2012-2013 (A/66/7, para. VIII.128). The proposals contained in document A/66/94 
would therefore represent additional requirements under section 30, Office of 
Information and Communications Technology ($5,639,100) and section 29D, Office 
of Central Support Services ($784,300). Upon request, the Committee was provided 
with the following clarification as to how each initiative was related to section 30 of 
the proposed programme budget, including information on the subprogramme and 
the organizational unit responsible for its implementation:

 A. General observations and recommendations 
 
 

71. The Advisory Committee recognizes the effort made to present a revised 
proposal for the implementation of the ICT strategy at a reduced cost. It notes 
the approach taken to integrate and combine, under each of the four enterprise 
ICT initiatives, the related structural review projects and ongoing activities of 
the Office, as well as proposals in response to outstanding requests of the 
General Assembly concerning enterprise content management, customer 
relationship management and disaster recovery and business continuity. The 
Committee considers that such an approach would avoid piecemeal 
implementation of the ICT strategy and also allow consolidation and 
streamlining of the reports on ICT matters submitted for consideration by the 
General Assembly. In the Committee’s view fragmented reporting is unhelpful 
and confusing. 

72. As to the substance of the proposals, which was extensively discussed in 
earlier reports, the Committee notes that the envisaged solutions are anchored 
in an analysis of the outcome of the structural review of ICT capacities across 
the Secretariat, which confirmed the fragmented state of the ICT environment 
and the need for greater coherence and coordination in the management of ICT 
activities (see A/65/491, paras. 93-103 and A/65/576, paras. 92-93). The 
Committee has, over the years, repeatedly stressed the need for common 
Secretariat-wide systems and platforms wherever possible, as well as central 
leadership for policy, strategic guidance and standard-setting in the area of 
information and communications technology, and broadly agrees with the 
approach proposed by the Secretary-General.  

73. Under the Improve enterprise ICT management initiative, the Secretary-
General outlines a strategy to address the question of ICT posts expected to be 
released and made available for redeployment through attrition, consolidation of 
ICT units at the departmental level, optimized distribution of Secretariat-wide ICT 
activities, or implementation of a global ICT staffing model (A/66/94, paras 20-27). 
He indicates that future proposals on any staff reduction will be prepared in close 
consultation with the relevant departments/offices and presented to the General 
Assembly for consideration, as part of the normal departmental budget submission 
process. He further states that any action approved by the Assembly will be 
implemented in close collaboration with the Office of Human Resources 
Management. The Advisory Committee is of the view that staffing implications 
of technological change can be accommodated through careful planning of 
future human resources needs, in consultation with all relevant departments. It 
emphasizes that acceptance of the direction and objectives of the ICT strategy 
will be key to the success of this endeavour, and recommends that every effort 
be made to ensure close cooperation of departments and offices across the 
Secretariat with the Office of Information and Communications Technology. 
The Committee also emphasizes that the Office of Information and 
Communications Technology should work closely with the Office of Human 
Resources Management in the design, development and implementation of the 
ICT global staffing model, which should be incorporated as part of a 
Secretariat-wide workforce planning exercise.  



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 24 
 

74. For each initiative, the Secretary-General sets out in some detail information 
on the qualitative and quantitative benefits that are expected from its 
implementation in terms of improved service delivery; transparency; distribution of 
ICT roles; utilization of ICT resources; coordination and coherence among ICT 
units, operations and processes; responsiveness to clients; support for substantive 
and knowledge management activities; and efficiency gains and cost savings to be 
realized through greater automation and reduced duplication. In annex IV to his 
report, the Secretary-General provides a quantitative benefit analysis for each 
initiative (except the Improve enterprise ICT management initiative), including, in 
monetary terms, the low and high range of estimated benefits for each expected 
improvement, along with information on the underlying assumptions and calculation 
methodology. The expected improvements cover a broad range of performance 
measures reflecting expected economies, efficiency gains or improved effectiveness, 
translated into time and cost savings or cost avoidance. The overall benefits 
expected to be realized on an annual basis are estimated at between $80.6 and 
$114.5 million.  

75. The Advisory Committee is of the view that, in some cases, the 
performance measures are lacking in specificity and that the estimated benefits 
are based on broad averages which do not appear to be very meaningful. For 
example, under the Leverage knowledge through ICT initiative, the improvement 
“Enhanced information-sharing across departments and locations” is expected to 
yield between $3 and $3.7 million in cost savings per year. The explanatory footnote 
indicates that the amount is based on the assumption that enhanced information-
sharing will allow some 8,000 people to save 10 minutes per week, and that 65 per 
cent of that time will be used productively. In this particular case, the Advisory 
Committee considers that differentiated targets by occupational group could be 
established, with more specific and measurable targets for productivity gains for 
each group. The Committee recommends that, for the purpose of establishing 
benchmarks, the Secretary-General be requested to continue to develop and 
refine the performance measures and the methodology applied for estimating 
the quantitative benefits resulting from economies, efficiency gains and 
improved effectiveness, and to provide, where relevant and to the extent 
possible, industry benchmarks for comparative purposes.  

76. In annex III to his report, the Secretary-General sets out the conditions that 
need to be in place for benefits to be realized, highlighting the indicative nature of 
the estimates and lack of reliable data to serve as the basis for the calculation. He 
further states that the potential savings would be available, at the earliest, after new 
processes and structures have been fully deployed and stabilized for at least one 
year. In the Advisory Committee’s view, given the conditions set out by the 
Secretary-General, the probability of effective realization of the expected 
quantified benefits in the future appears to be hypothetical at this stage. In this 
regard, the Committee points out that, even under the best of circumstances, 
projects with long timescales present considerable risks as to the effective 
realization of the targets planned at inception, owing to the changes occurring 
over time to project objectives, implementation activities and costs, as well as 
turnover of project personnel. The Committee is of the view that the future 
credibility of the ICT strategy depends on demonstrating the realization of 
actual benefits in future progress reports. It expects that the actual quantified 
benefits realized will be reported in the annual reports of the Secretary-General 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

25 11-60207 
 

on progress in the implementation of the ICT strategy. The Committee 
considers that the findings of the structural review (see para. 61 above) 
constitute a baseline of the status of ICT from which progress should be 
measured. 

77. In making its observations and recommendations on the individual initiatives 
in section III.C below, the Advisory Committee focused its attention on the 
differences between earlier and current proposals, the proposed resource 
requirements and activities accomplished since the issuance of the previous report 
(A/65/491). In that report, the Secretary-General provided an in-depth analysis of 
the outcome of the structural review of ICT capacities across the Secretariat, with an 
Organization-wide perspective on the ICT resources and state of the ICT 
environment of the United Nations. He also provided detailed information on the 
rationale, objectives, benefits and implementation plans of the four projects 
proposed to address the findings of the structural review. In its related report, the 
Advisory Committee commented extensively on those proposals. The Committee 
points out that, while the current report of the Secretary-General revises and 
repackages the structural review projects as enterprise ICT initiatives, 
broadens their scope in some areas and incorporates additional requirements 
such as enterprise content management, the thrust of the main proposals 
remains unchanged. The weaknesses that the proposals are intended to address 
likewise remain unchanged. The Committee’s related observations and 
recommendations in its report A/65/576 also remain valid. 

78. In paragraphs 41 to 59 of his previous report on the status of implementation 
of the ICT strategy (A/65/491), the Secretary-General provided an update on the 
objectives and key activities undertaken and planned with respect to the ICT 
management framework and each of the three ICT strategic programmes: knowledge 
management, resource management and infrastructure management. In its related 
report, the Advisory Committee expressed its appreciation for the presentation of a 
comprehensive overview of the ICT activities undertaken Secretariat-wide, 
including the update on the implementation status of key enterprise systems (see 
A/65/576, para. 58). The Committee recommends that the Secretary-General be 
requested to continue to provide a similarly comprehensive update and to 
further expand on the status of the major enterprise systems under 
development in the next annual progress report on the implementation of the 
ICT strategy.  

79. In its previous report, the Advisory Committee recommended that the 
Secretary-General review the prioritization and phasing of the structural review 
projects and present alternative implementation approaches (ibid., para. 99). While 
noting the attention that has been given to the Committee’s comments and 
recommendations in the formulation and presentation of the enterprise ICT 
initiatives, as well as the efforts made to lower overall costs, the Committee 
points out that the proposals for the enterprise ICT initiatives still represent a 
significant outlay. Moreover, the Committee is not convinced that the whole 
range of activities associated with the four enterprise ICT initiatives needs to be 
implemented at the same time. In the light of the difficulties encountered in the 
management of the Umoja project, the Committee is equally unconvinced about 
the Secretariat’s capacity to undertake and successfully execute a large number 
of complex, management reform initiatives concurrently, in particular 
initiatives involving significant institutional change (see para. 59 above). 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 26 
 

Furthermore, given the tight timetable for the adoption of IPSAS by 2014 (see 
A/66/379), the Committee believes that the Secretariat should, to the extent 
possible, avoid launching major new initiatives and proceed with the 
implementation of ongoing projects in a more gradual manner that allows 
proper analysis and absorption of the lessons learned from recent experience. 
Accordingly, in its discussion on individual initiatives in section III.C below, the 
Committee recommends that the Secretary-General further reprioritize and 
reduce the scope of the activities envisaged for the biennium 2012-2013 under 
each of the four enterprise ICT initiatives and identify the features that could 
be postponed without cutting short or negatively impacting ongoing activities 
or compromising return on investments already made. 
 
 

 B. Overall resource requirements 
 
 

80. The tables below provide a summary of the resource requirements for the four 
initiatives by object of expenditure and funding source for the biennium 2012-2013 
and the low and high range estimates for the biennium 2014-2015 and beyond. The 
Advisory Committee was informed that, except for the 14 regular budget posts, 
which are proposed to be established under the first initiative and represent ongoing 
expenditures, funding for all other activities envisaged under the four initiatives 
represented a one-time investment, and that no further costs would be required upon 
completion of the implementation. The Committee notes that a significant 
proportion of the resource requirements is proposed under contractual services. To 
facilitate consideration of the proposed requirements, a breakdown by type of 
expenditure for software licences and tools, personnel costs, hardware and 
infrastructure, and change management activities is provided in table 1 below.

 C. Observations and recommendations on individual initiatives 
 
 

 1. Improve enterprise ICT management 
 

81. The Secretary-General’s proposals for the Improve enterprise ICT management 
initiative, are presented in paragraphs 8 to 53 of his report. The initiative combines 
and builds on two previous interrelated proposals, which were presented in 
document A/65/491: structural review project 3, Rationalize the ICT organization, 
and structural review project 4, Strengthen the Office of Information and 
Communications Technology. As indicated in paragraph 62 above, by its resolution 
65/259, the General Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to proceed with 
structural review project 3, Rationalize ICT organization and decided that the 
$1.5 million required for the project for 2011 would be provided from within the 
resources approved for the biennium 2010-2011. The Assembly also decided to 
provide general temporary assistance equivalent to seven P-4 positions for structural 
review project 4, Strengthen the Office of Information and Communications 
Technology, of which five were to be funded from within existing resources for 
2010-2011. The Secretary-General indicates that resource requirements continue to 
be monitored in order to identify funding for the $1.5 million and 5 P-4 general 
temporary positions approved for the project from within existing resources. At the 
time of its consideration of the Secretary-General’s current proposal in July 2011, 
the Advisory Committee was informed that funding for those resources had not yet 
been identified and that recruitment for two P-4 general temporary assistance 
positions was under way. The Committee was further informed that the resources for 
the two P-4 general temporary assistance positions were provided on a one-time 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 28 
 

basis for 2011 and were not proposed to be continued in the budgetary proposals for 
section 30 for the biennium 2012-2013 (see A/66/7, para. VIII.134).  

82. The Advisory Committee was informed that the objectives and implementation 
approach for the Rationalize ICT organization portion of the initiative remained 
largely unchanged as compared to the previous proposal in document A/65/491. 
However, the implementation schedule had been adapted to reflect the activities 
already completed, which included, inter alia: the definition of ICT functions, jobs 
and sourcing rules; the organizational review of OICT; and the design of criteria and 
processes for a departmental review of ICT units (see A/66/94, para. 38 and fig. II). 
The Committee was also informed that the Office had established a new ICT 
governance framework and a client services function, developed several ICT 
policies, increased its use of standards and reviewed Secretariat-wide ICT budget 
proposals.  

83. In paragraph 16 of his report, the Secretary-General indicates that there are 
close to 2,000 applications, which will be reduced through sustained coordination of 
cross-cutting ICT functions and as a result of the implementation of the enterprise 
resource planning system, Umoja. In its previous report, the Committee 
recommended that the Umoja project team establish, in cooperation with the Office 
of Information and Communications Technology, an inventory of the applications 
that could be replaced by the enterprise resource planning system. It expressed the 
view that the activities related to the planning of decommissioning activities should 
be coordinated by the Office of Information and Communications Technology, in the 
context of the projects arising from the outcome of the structural review of ICT 
capacities (A/65/576, para. 32). The Advisory Committee emphasizes the 
importance of reducing the fragmentation of applications and infrastructures 
and eliminating duplicate and redundant systems (see also paras. 39 and 40 
above). A comprehensive inventory of Organization-wide applications and 
infrastructure that could be consolidated or replaced should be established. 
The Committee recommends that the Secretary-General be requested to pursue 
his analysis and to provide information on progress in this regard in the context 
of his next progress report.  

84. As regards the proposals for the strengthening of the Office of Information and 
Communications Technology, the Secretary-General indicates that an organizational 
review of the Office was conducted in 2010 as part of the Rationalize ICT 
organization structural review project (A/66/94, para. 31). According to the 
Secretary-General, the review determined that seven critical cross-cutting functions 
were understaffed and required strengthening to enable the Office to make progress 
in implementing the ICT strategy in the areas of: enterprise architecture and 
standards; security and risk management; strategic planning and policy 
development; ICT portfolio management, including ICT financial management; ICT 
performance management; business relationship management; and technology 
research (A/66/94, paras. 31-34). On the basis of the findings of the review, the 
Secretary-General is proposing to redeploy seven positions within the Office from 
operational to cross-cutting functions, as well as to establish 14 new posts (2 D-2,  
2 P-5, 10 P-4) in the biennium 2012-2013, to further strengthen capacity in those 
cross-cutting areas. Annex II to the report of the Secretary-General provides an 
organizational chart of the proposed structure of OICT for the biennium 2012-2013, 
showing the proposed redeployments and new posts by division/service and 
subprogramme.  



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

29 11-60207 
 

85. Figure II of the report shows the schedule of the key implementation activities 
to be undertaken in the context of the Improve enterprise ICT initiative, which are 
described in paragraph 44 of the report. The Secretary-General indicates that work 
will continue on implementing the global ICT staffing model and standardizing 
functional titles and job descriptions, in close consultation with the Office of Human 
Resources Management. All ICT units in the Secretariat will be reviewed, resulting 
in recommendations on structural changes to the units, their reporting arrangements 
within their respective departments and offices, and a clear division of labour 
among ICT service providers. As indicated in paragraph 20 of the report, the review 
of ICT units will lead to proposals for the consolidation of ICT units at the 
departmental level and Secretariat-wide optimized distribution of ICT activities, 
including a reduction in overall ICT staffing needs 

86. The Advisory Committee notes that the recommendations will be presented to 
the General Assembly for consideration (see also para. 73 above) as part of the 
budgetary process, in the context of the proposed programme budget for 2014-2015 
for departments/offices at Headquarters and at offices away from Headquarters, and 
as part of the peacekeeping budget proposals for the period 2013/14 as regards any 
recommendation concerning the Department of Field Support and an initial “wave” 
of field missions reviewed. The Secretary-General envisages implementation of any 
changes approved by the General Assembly starting in the second part of 2013 for 
the initial field missions and in 2014 for departments/offices at Headquarters and in 
offices away from Headquarters. He indicates that the strengthening of the cross-
cutting ICT functions constitutes an ongoing effort, initiated in 2011, which is to be 
continued throughout the duration of the implementation of the ICT strategy. 

87. Resource requirements estimated for the initiative amount to $8.4 million, 
comprising: (a) $2,883,600 in relation to the proposed establishment of 14 posts  
(2 D-2, 2 P-5, 10 P-4); (b) $1,346,600 for general temporary assistance equivalent to 
two posts at the P-5 level, two posts at the P-4 level and one post at the P-3 level for 
12 months each in 2012, and one post at the P-4 level for an additional 6 months in 
2013 to carry out activities related to the rationalization of ICT structures and 
development of the ICT global staffing model and strategic workforce planning 
framework; (c) $150,000 for travel of staff; (d) $498,000 for contractual services to 
cover requirements for change management for the estimated 5 to 10 per cent of ICT 
staff that will be redeployed towards different job functions; (e) $2,973,700 under 
general operating expenses to cover expenditures for rental of premises and other 
costs in connection with the establishment of the proposed posts and the 
continuation of general temporary assistance; and (f) $502,000 under furniture and 
equipment, also in relation to proposed posts and staffing. The delayed impact of the 
14 proposed posts from the biennium 2014-2015 is currently estimated at 
$2,325,600 (see A/66/94, table 1 and paras. 45-53). 

88. Details on the functions of the proposed posts are provided in paragraph 35 of 
the report of the Secretary-General. The Advisory Committee was informed that 7 of 
the 10 P-4 posts proposed corresponded to the 7 general temporary assistance 
positions previously approved by the General Assembly (see resolution 65/259 and 
para. 81 above), which were being proposed for conversion. The 14 posts proposed 
for establishment/conversion are as follows:  



A/66/7/Add.1

 A/66/7/Add.1
 

31 11-60207 
 

 (vi) One P-4 Officer for ICT portfolio management is proposed for 
conversion in the Strategic Management Service. The incumbent would be 
responsible for maintaining the inventory of ICT capacities established in the 
context of the structural review and creating appropriate processes and systems 
to ensure transparency of the ICT expenditures of the Organization and to 
support decision-making on ICT investments; 

 (vii) Two P-4 Officers for business relationship management are proposed for 
conversion in the Strategic Management Service. The incumbents would be 
responsible for establishing, managing and maintaining strategic relationships 
with customers across the Organization in order to ensure alignment of ICT 
solutions with the needs of the Organization. They would also be responsible 
for negotiating the consolidation of similar applications across substantive 
areas and reducing the number of redundant applications. 

 (c) Under subprogramme 6, ICT operations: 

 (i) One D-2 post for a Director is proposed in the Infrastructure 
Management Service. The incumbent would be responsible for providing 
direction and coordination of enterprise infrastructure development and 
operations, including global ICT disaster recovery, as well as for leading the 
United Nations system-wide infrastructure harmonization efforts. He/she 
would be responsible for driving the Organization-wide infrastructure 
architecture and standardization and ensuring increased availability and 
reliability of the global ICT infrastructure; 

 (ii) One P-5 post is proposed for the Chief of the Field Systems Service for 
enterprise applications development in the field. The incumbent would be 
responsible for leading the Field Systems Service, which has been operating 
without a Chief since its transfer to the Office of Information and 
Communications Technology from the Department of Field Support on 
1 February 2009. 

 (d) Under programme support: 

 (i) One P-4 post is proposed for human resources management in the 
Executive Office;  

 (ii) One P-4 post is proposed for financial management in the Executive 
Office. 

89. Recognizing the need for direction and coordination of enterprise ICT 
infrastructure, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the proposed 
post for a Director for the Infrastructure Management Service at the D-2 level. 
Pending completion of the Secretary-General’s review of all ICT units in the 
Secretariat and the availability of further information on overall ICT staffing 
needs (see paras. 85 and 86 above), the Committee believes that it would be 
premature to establish new ICT posts for the Office of Information and 
Communications Technology. It recognizes, however, the need to temporarily 
augment the capacity of the Office of Information and Communications 
Technology to undertake the strategic, cross-cutting activities of its broadened, 
Organization-wide mandate, including the development of enterprise 
architecture and standards (see A/65/576, para. 100). Bearing in mind the 
General Assembly’s decisions on the Secretary-General’s earlier proposals (see 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 32 
 

para. 62 above), the Advisory Committee recommends continuation of the seven 
P-4 general temporary assistance positions approved by the General Assembly 
in its resolution 65/259. The Committee recommends against approval of the 
remaining proposals for the D-2 post for a Director for global strategy 
management, the P-5 post for ICT security management, the P-5 post for the 
Chief of the Field Systems Service for enterprise applications development in 
the field, the P-4 post for a Communications Officer in the Office of the Chief 
Information Technology Officer and the two P-4 posts under programme 
support.  
 

 2. Leverage knowledge through information and communications technology 
 

90. The second initiative, Leverage knowledge through ICT, formerly referred to 
as enterprise content management, is designed to provide an integrated knowledge 
management programme comprising functions for collaboration, document/records 
management, web content management and enterprise search. The proposal also 
responds to paragraph 126 of resolution 64/243, in which the General Assembly 
requested the Secretary-General to submit a fully justified proposal for post and 
non-post resources concerning the implementation of enterprise content 
management in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 
2012-2013. The Advisory Committee recalls that enterprise content management 
was not covered under the previous proposals for four structural review projects 
contained in document A/65/491.  

91. The Secretary-General’s proposals for the Leverage knowledge through ICT 
initiative are set out in paragraphs 54 to 82 of his report (A/66/94). The key 
challenges to be addressed in implementing the initiative include the lack of 
Organization-wide standards and tools for effective web publishing and 
collaboration, as well as the absence of a centralized document repository and 
taxonomical classification to facilitate search and use of information stored in 
numerous repositories across the Organization (A/66/94, para. 57). The Secretary-
General indicates that a knowledge management road map was developed in 2009 
through collaboration between departments and offices, discussions within the 
Working Group on Knowledge Management and with the assistance of knowledge 
management experts. The road map showed that the prevalence of inconsistent 
knowledge management activities and inconsistent use of technological tools 
continued to impede the Organization’s ability to carry out its programmes 
effectively, while needlessly increasing the cost of operations (A/66/94, para. 56).  

92. The Secretary-General indicates that the objectives pursued under the 
Leverage knowledge through ICT initiative are to create enterprise-wide platforms; 
improve and enhance analysis and decision-making support capabilities; improve 
information management policies and processes; facilitate and enhance knowledge 
sharing and collaboration; improve the management of websites and their content; 
improve the organization, accessibility and usability of information; and retain 
institutional knowledge (ibid., para. 59).  

93. The qualitative and quantitative benefits expected through the implementation 
of the initiative are set out in paragraphs 61 and 62 of the Secretary-General’s 
report. The Secretary-General indicates that the amount of resources devoted to 
knowledge management activities, although currently unavailable with any degree 
of precision, is estimated to be very high, given the extensive fragmentation of the 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

33 11-60207 
 

content management processes, tools and resources of the Organization. After full 
implementation, it is estimated that the overall savings from this initiative will range 
between $23 million and $28 million on an annual recurring basis. Details of the 
expected improvements and resulting savings are provided in annex IV to the 
Secretary-General’s report. The Advisory Committee points out that its 
comments in paragraph 75 above, on the need for continued refinement of 
performance measures and the methodology for estimating savings and 
efficiency gains, apply equally to the benefits identified with respect to the 
Leverage knowledge through ICT initiative.  

94. The implementation plan for the Leverage knowledge through ICT initiative is 
outlined in paragraphs 63 to 76 of the Secretary-General’s report, covering the 
approach, key implementation activities and schedule. The Advisory Committee 
notes that the following set of four core knowledge management capabilities will be 
implemented at each duty station:  

 (a) A collaboration component, to enable the Organization to build virtual 
partnerships, share knowledge, find experts and form communities of practice. The 
current tool in place, e-Room, will be supplemented by more modern tools allowing 
blogging, wikis and further options for United Nations personnel to connect and 
consult with one another; 

 (b) A documents records management component, to enable the Organization 
to create, use, share, retain and dispose of documents and other kinds of content, 
such as e-mail, in line with enterprise policies, standards and guidelines. The 
Secretary-General indicates that on the basis of the enterprise content management 
road map developed in 2009 (see para. 91 above), a standard documents/records 
management system was developed late in 2010, designed to provide a centralized, 
secure and scalable repository for all types of United Nations documents. Its main 
functionalities include: creating document management workflows; enabling 
document library services such as check-in, check-out and version control; 
managing retention and disposal rules and schedules; securing access to documents; 
and digitizing paper documents. The project is to be implemented in phases over 
two bienniums (2012-2013 and 2014-2015), supported by the Office of Information 
and Communications Technology. In addition, the Official Document System (ODS) 
will be migrated to the system to improve ODS functionality and reliability; 

 (c) A web content management component, to enable the Organization to 
improve its Internet presence by facilitating the configuration, deployment, 
customization and optimization of sites, site collections, pages, web parts and 
documents. The project will first create an “iSeek 2.0” for the Secretariat’s Intranet, 
and development work will be piloted on selected Internet websites. The web 
content management system will subsequently be applied to high-impact United 
Nations websites, including www.un.org, and will eventually be based on a global 
platform, built in accordance with appropriate governance rules for policies, 
procedures, guidelines and standards and with support services that oversee, 
streamline and provide quality assurance for the creation of new websites; 

 (d) An enterprise search component will index a large volume of information 
and knowledge in various repositories, and enable the Organization to search and 
find relevant information in a more effective way. The Secretary-General indicates 
that, initially, the enterprise search system will be applied to existing document 
repositories, such as www.un.org, ODS and iSeek, and subsequently to other sources 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 34 
 

of information in the documents/records management and collaboration 
environments. As new repositories are introduced, they will be included in the 
enterprise search system, ultimately resulting in a one-stop search portal for the 
entire Organization, Member States and other stakeholders. 

95. The Secretary-General states that these components must be implemented 
together in order to improve the ability of the Organization to gather, analyse, 
synthesize and present information throughout the entire life cycle of institutional 
knowledge and make knowledge more accessible to all stakeholders, worldwide. He 
also highlights the requirement for the full support of departments/offices and the 
need to plan and coordinate implementation through well-organized governance 
mechanisms, in order to achieve success and ensure the adoption of improved 
knowledge management policies, processes and technology tools. The governance 
mechanisms in place to ensure such coordination include the ICT Executive 
Committee, the ICT Advisory Group, the Working Group on Knowledge 
Management and the managers of departments and offices throughout the 
Secretariat (ibid., paras. 63-65).  

96. Figure IV of the Secretary-General’s report shows the implementation 
schedule of the key activities to be accomplished in 2012-2013, including: 
establishing enterprise-wide knowledge management infrastructure and governance; 
initiating pilot projects on collaboration and documents/records management; 
initiating pilot projects on web content management; rolling out knowledge 
management activities for up to 10 departments, offices away from Headquarters 
and field missions; and establishing enterprise search capabilities. In 2014-2015, it 
is envisaged to roll out and support knowledge management to remaining 
departments, offices away from Headquarters and field missions, and to maintain 
service delivery (ibid., para. 76).  

97. The total resources proposed for the biennium 2012-2013 for the 
implementation of the initiative amount to $11.5 million, comprising $1.7 million in 
regular budget resources, $7.1 million from the support account and $2.6 million 
from extrabudgetary funding sources. The Advisory Committee notes that the 
totality of the resources proposed represents a one-time cost that would no longer be 
required after full implementation of the initiative (see para. 80 above). It was 
informed that, in comparison, the previous proposals for enterprise content 
management put forward in document A/62/510/Rev.1 amounted to $14.9 million. 
The Secretary-General indicates that the requirements for his current proposal were 
reduced through the adoption of a phased approach starting with a pilot 
implementation, and also by building on knowledge management activities already 
accomplished within existing resources since the elaboration of the initial proposals. 
The Committee was also informed that progress had been made in the following 
areas: issuance of policies and standards by the Working Group on Knowledge 
Management; procurement and setting up of an enterprise content management 
platform; selective deployment of collaboration tools; piloting of a document and 
records management and information portal; and improvement of the search 
functions of ODS and other repositories. 

98. The estimated requirements of $11.5 million proposed for the implementation 
of the initiative in 2012-2013 are broken down as follows: (a) $196,000 for travel of 
staff; (b) $10,057,200 for contractual services, comprising $3,013,000 for additional 
software licences and maintenance, $4,755,800 for contractual personnel, $572,600 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

35 11-60207 
 

for hardware and storage, and $1,715,800 for change management activities; 
(c) $1,059,600 under general operating expenses for common support costs related 
to the contractual personnel proposed; and (d) $176,000 under furniture and 
equipment, also in relation to the contractual personnel positions proposed. The 
Advisory Committee requested clarification on the requirement of $1,715,800 for 
change management and services related to the delivery of change management 
activities (ibid., para. 79 (d)). It was informed that change management activities 
were integrated as part of the ICT project management methodology to minimize the 
disruptions caused by the adoption of new applications, technologies and business 
processes, and that the inclusion of funding for such activities was considered a best 
practice when implementing large ICT projects entailing the adoption of new 
technologies and working methods.  

99. The Advisory Committee recognizes the existing weaknesses in the 
management of information and the need to provide the Organization with 
enhanced tools and processes to capture, retain and share knowledge, as well as 
to search for and retrieve information more effectively and efficiently. While 
noting the Secretary-General’s comment on the need to implement the four 
components of the initiative together, the Committee is of the view that 
implementation of the whole range of activities planned for 2012-2013, 
including the roll-out of all four components to 10 departments, is overly 
optimistic. It believes that the Secretary-General should seek alternative 
solutions for implementing the four components of the initiative at lower cost, 
and identify activities or features that could be postponed without jeopardizing 
the overall implementation of the initiative. In view of the above, as well as its 
observations in paragraph 79 above, the Committee recommends that the 
Secretary-General be authorized to proceed with the implementation of the 
Leverage Knowledge through ICT initiative, but at reduced cost and scope.  
 

 3. Enhance information and communications technology service delivery  
 

100. The third initiative, enhance ICT service delivery, revises the Secretary-
General’s previous proposal for the globalization of service desks, Structural review 
project 1 (see A/65/491). The initiative will incorporate the ongoing implementation 
of the customer relationship management system, entitled iNeed, that service desks 
throughout the Secretariat can use to record and track requests from United Nations 
personnel. The initiative also integrates proposals in response to paragraph 126 of 
resolution 64/243, in which the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General 
to submit a fully justified proposal for post and non-post resources concerning the 
implementation of customer relationship management in the context of the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013. 

101. In his previous report (A/65/491) the Secretary-General described at some 
length the findings of the structural review with respect to the management of 
service desks across the Secretariat, as well as the rationale, implementation 
activities and expected benefits of his proposals for the globalization of service 
desks. The Secretary-General’s revised proposals for enhancing information and 
communications technology service delivery are set out in paragraphs 83 to 112 of 
his report (A/66/94). He states that a high degree of fragmentation exists in this 
area, with at least 131 ICT service desks worldwide. Moreover, the service desks do 
not have standard working methods in accordance with best practice, and use tools 
with limited functionality to support service desks and workstation operations. The 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 36 
 

Secretary-General further indicates that, at present, it is difficult to assess the 
quantity and quality of the service delivery processes, which impedes the 
Organization’s ability to assign resources efficiently and establish work units that 
can address the complexity and volume of services needed. The lack of 
standardization increases complexity and fragmentation, and also drives up the costs 
of user services. 

102. The key objectives for the Enhance ICT service delivery initiative are 
enumerated in paragraph 89 of the report. The aim is to, inter alia, improve the 
quality, standards, availability and efficiency of ICT service delivery at all duty 
stations; implement an enterprise ICT global service catalogue; establish a minimal 
number of standardized workstation configurations based on the applications 
required by all users; and implement business intelligence software to enable 
performance monitoring. The Secretary-General proposes to consolidate the 131 
ICT service desk functions into a minimum of three regional enterprise ICT service 
desks which would provide all Secretariat offices with support for common 
applications such as Umoja, e-mail and Inspira. Unique site-specific services would 
continue to be provided locally, with a significantly reduced number of ICT service 
desk staff. The three enterprise service desks would be established in different time 
zones (for example in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa) and 
would be able to service all United Nations locations worldwide. At any given time 
of the day, at least one of the three service centres would be operational, allowing, 
in effect, provision of services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to all locations.  

103. The qualitative and quantitative benefits expected through the implementation 
of the initiative are described in paragraphs 91 and 92 of the report. The Secretary-
General indicates that the implementation of the Enhance ICT service delivery 
initiative will provide qualitative benefits in terms of improved capability to resolve 
issues quickly and consistently, the provision of multilingual support on a 24-hours-
a-day, 7-days-a-week basis, increased responsiveness to users and greater 
productivity. The Committee also notes that a common telephone extension number, 
such as 3333, will be provided for all locations and that a user self-service 
capability will allow United Nations personnel to resolve their problems without the 
intervention of service agents or other technical staff, thereby decreasing the 
workload of service desk agents. Overall, annual savings expected after full 
implementation are estimated at between $39.7 and $59.6 million, comprising 
savings resulting from the introduction of self-service functions ($6.6 to 
$9.9 million); the automation of ICT asset management ($10.3 to $15.4 million); the 
automation of service desks ($1.4 to $2 million); the introduction of workstation 
standards and a reduced set of workstation configurations ($7.5 to $11.3 million); 
automated workstation management ($7.4 to $11.2 million); and the migration of 
common service functions from local service desks to the regional desks ($6.5 to 
$9.8 million). The Committee’s comments on the need for continued refinement of 
the performance measures and the methodology for estimating savings and 
efficiency gains (see para. 75 above) apply equally to the benefits related to the 
Enhance ICT service delivery initiative. The Advisory Committee notes that the 
Organization currently spends approximately $135 million annually on ICT service 
desk operations, comprising $39.6 million for equipment and $95.4 million for 
labour costs to provide for approximately 835 full-time equivalent employees, 
comprising 618 staff and 217 contractors. 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

37 11-60207 
 

104. The Advisory Committee notes that, in addition to ICT service delivery, the 
regional service centres will also be capable of addressing service requests in other 
functional areas, such as facilities, human resources, procurement and financial 
services. The Secretary-General indicates that the Office of Information and 
Communications Technology, the Department of Field Support and other ICT units 
will work closely with departments and offices to identify other such administrative 
services. 

105. The Secretary-General indicates that a key element of the revised strategy is to 
leverage investments in the existing enterprise customer relationship management 
(iNeed) and enterprise identity management systems to record all service calls and 
to validate the identity of users, thereby significantly reducing the overall 
implementation cost of the initiative (A/66/94, para. 93). In paragraph 102 of the 
report, the Secretary-General provides information on the progress to date since the 
introduction of the customer relationship management concept in 2008 (see 
A/62/510/Rev.1). The Advisory Committee notes that, in addition to the Office of 
Information and Communications Technology and the Department of Field Support, 
the iNeed system has been deployed in selected departments/offices at Headquarters 
and at offices away from Headquarters, as well as at the United Nations Logistics 
Base and in some field missions. Figure VI of the Secretary-General’s report shows 
the implementation schedule for the various activities of the initiative.  

106. The total resources proposed for the biennium 2012-2013 for the 
implementation of the initiative amount to $13.1 million, comprising $2 million in 
regular budget resources, $8.2 million from the support account and $3 million from 
extrabudgetary funding sources. The previous proposals for structural review project 1, 
Globalize service desks (see A/65/491) and customer relationship management (see 
A/62/501/Rev.1) amounted to some $24 million (see annex VII below). The 
Secretary-General indicates that the requirements for his current proposal were 
reduced through the adoption of a phased approach and by leveraging previous 
investments and existing systems to the maximum extent possible. The estimated 
requirements of $13.2 million for Secretariat-wide implementation activities during 
the biennium 2012-2013 are broken down as follows: (a) $165,000 for travel of 
staff; (b) $11,103,500 for contractual services, comprising $3,947,300 to license 
service desk and workstation toolsets and $7,156,200 for contractual personnel; 
(c) $443,300 under general operating expenses for common support costs related to 
the contractual personnel proposed; (d) $1,166,100 under supplies and materials to 
cover the costs related to the establishment of regional service centres; and 
(e) $274,000 under furniture and equipment to cover the costs of the additional 
servers required for the infrastructure of the service desk software. The Advisory 
Committee notes that the totality of the resources proposed are for one-time costs 
that would no longer be required after full implementation of the initiative (see 
para. 81 above).  

107. The Advisory Committee believes that the Secretary-General’s proposal 
for the replacement of a majority of the existing 131 information technology 
service desks with three global service centres has far-reaching implications 
and would have an impact on the day-to-day operations of United Nations duty 
stations worldwide. The Committee is not convinced that, at this stage, all the 
possible ramifications of such an initiative are fully known or understood. 
Moreover, the Committee is of the view that it will only be possible to 
determine the full extent of the requirements for service desks once a clearer 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 38 
 

picture emerges of the service delivery model that will be adopted by the United 
Nations and the manner in which the current fragmentation of applications and 
infrastructure will be reduced (see para. 83 above). The Committee therefore 
considers that the Secretary-General should proceed with implementation 
activities in a gradual manner, identifying features that could be postponed 
without jeopardizing implementation of the overall initiative, and seeking 
further opportunities for lowering implementation costs. In view of the above, 
and taking into account its observations in paragraph 79 above, the Committee 
recommends that the Secretary-General be authorized to proceed with the 
implementation of the Enhance ICT service delivery initiative, but at reduced 
cost and scope. 
 

 4. Create resilient information and communications technology infrastructure  
 

108. The fourth initiative, Create resilient ICT infrastructure, presents a 
reformulated proposal integrating Structural review project 2, Streamline data 
centres (see A/65/491) and the requirements for a unified disaster recovery and 
business continuity plan for the Secretariat, including a permanent solution for 
Headquarters, as requested by the General Assembly in its resolutions 63/262 and 
63/269 (A/66/94, paras. 113-149).  

109. The Secretary-General indicates that the current ICT infrastructure is based on 
a decentralized approach, focused on the needs of individual duty stations, which 
was consistently favoured and deemed necessary to ensure reliable infrastructure 
operations, given that global data communications were not dependable (A/66/94, 
para. 113). This model of operations is still in use and has resulted in the existence 
of at least 34 data centres and 177 server rooms across the Secretariat, comprising 
18 data centres and 63 server rooms at Headquarters, offices away from 
Headquarters and the regional commissions, and 16 data centres and 114 server 
rooms in field missions. With the exception of the United Nations Logistics Base, 
which provides disaster recovery facilities for field missions, all other duty stations 
are individually responsible for their own back-up infrastructure.  

110. The Secretary-General states that the rationale for continued decentralization 
is no longer valid, given the significant progress achieved over the past 10 years in 
facilitating interconnectivity among all duty stations through the new generation of 
communication technologies. The adoption of an enterprise approach and a shared-
services model to support all Secretariat duty stations will lead to savings through 
economies of scale, gradually reduce the scope of local data centre facilities and 
provide disaster recovery services to duty stations according to their needs, thereby 
creating a resilient ICT infrastructure (A/66/94, para. 116). Pursuant to General 
Assembly resolution 63/269, in which the General Assembly requested the 
Secretary-General to ensure that the United Nations used enterprise data centres 
rather than local data centres as far as possible, the Secretariat’s strategy shifted 
towards the enterprise management of ICT infrastructure.  

111. The key objectives of the reformulated initiative are to implement two 
enterprise data centres, one at the United Nations Logistics Base and another at the 
secondary data centre at Valencia, and to centrally host all enterprise applications, 
such as Umoja, e-mail, Inspira, iNeed and the enterprise identity management 
system. Unique, site-specific applications will continue to be hosted in local data 
centres (A/66/94, para. 121). In paragraphs 127 to 130 of his report the Secretary-



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

39 11-60207 
 

General provides details of the implementation approach, which rests on the 
following key elements: establishment of the enterprise data centre at the United 
Nations Logistics Base and a mirror resilience site at Valencia; conformity of all 
applications to the architecture, policies and procedures of the enterprise and local 
data centres; standardization of the server and storage environments; virtualization 
of servers to reduce the number of server rooms; reduction of the existing storage 
space; management of small locations remotely; and utilization of iNeed at all 
locations. The Secretary-General indicates that the streamlining of data centres, 
which reduces the number of data centre locations and provides an enterprise 
approach to server and storage management, will also facilitate and lower the costs 
for the provision and maintenance of disaster recovery capabilities. The Advisory 
Committee notes that the Office of Information and Communications Technology 
and the Department of Field Support collaborated to formulate the implementation 
approach to make the infrastructure ready for the global field support strategy and 
Umoja.  

112. The qualitative and quantitative benefits expected through the implementation 
of the initiative are described in paragraphs 124 and 125 of the report. With regard 
to the qualitative benefits, the Advisory Committee notes that the implementation of 
the Create resilient ICT infrastructure initiative will allow an increase in data centre 
performance and availability; an augmentation of disaster recovery capabilities and 
business resilience, ensuring thereby that the Organization can continue to operate 
during and after crises; and the promotion of sustainable use of ICT through a 
reduced number of physical servers and reduced consumption of power. With regard 
to the quantitative benefits, the Secretary-General’s estimates for overall annual 
savings expected after full implementation of the initiative at Headquarters and at 
offices away from Headquarters are estimated at between $17.9 million and $26.9 
million, comprising savings resulting from: the introduction of software to provide 
one source for all e-mail archives at the United Nations Logistics Base ($1.3 to 
$2 million); the elimination of duplicate files ($1.3 to $2 million); reduced 
requirements for equipment and labour resulting from the hosting of enterprise 
applications in one location for all duty stations ($2.8 to $4.2 million per enterprise 
application); reduced requirements for server and storage labour resulting from the 
use of a reduced set of server and storage management and monitoring tools ($5 to 
$7.5 million); and the migration of local server rooms to enterprise data centres 
($5.4 to $8 million). The Committee notes that current annual expenditure on data 
centres at Headquarters and at offices away from Headquarters amounts to 
approximately $104 million, comprising $54.2 million for staff costs for 
approximately 552 full-time equivalent employees, and $49.6 million for equipment. 
The Committee also notes that the figures provided above do not include savings 
achieved at field missions, which are to be reported by the Department of Field 
Support (A/66/94, para. 126). 

113. The Secretary-General states that a key strategy of the reformulated initiative 
was to build on the significant investment already made in the enterprise data 
centres at the United Nations Logistics Base and at Valencia for peacekeeping 
operations to provide a resilient platform for the deployment of enterprise 
applications. He indicates that requirements for 2012-2013 were reduced by 
adopting a phased approach to implementation, fully leveraging internal capacities 
and existing Department of Field Support investment in the United Nations 
Logistics Base and reducing requirements for capital investment through leasing 



A/66/7/Add.1

instead of purchasing. In addition, the Secretary-General states that a number of 
factors were taken into account in developing the reformulated proposal, such as the 
continued improvements made in the context of the capital master plan at 
Headquarters and of the United Nations Logistics Base, the construction of the 
secondary data centre at Valencia and ongoing network upgrades to enable high-
speed and multiple path connections across major duty stations, which are expected 
to be implemented early in 2012. 

114. The total resources proposed for the biennium 2012-2013 for the 
implementation of the initiative amount to $9.8 million, comprising $1.5 million in 
regular budget resources, $6.1 million from the support account and $2.3 million 
from extrabudgetary funding sources. In comparison, the costs of the previous 
proposals for the structural review project for streamlining data centres and 
developing a unified disaster recovery and business continuity plan were estimated 
at $15.8 million (see para. 113 above; see also annex VII below). The overall 
proposed resource requirements of $9.8 million comprise the following:  
(a) $511,200 for general temporary assistance equivalent to one post at the P-5 level 
to lead efforts to operationalize the enterprise data centres at the United Nations 
Logistics Base and the United Nations Support Base at Valencia and the integrated 
management information system (IMIS) disaster recovery initiatives; (b) $4,369,500 
for contractual services, comprising $2,230,200 for software licences for server and 
storage management tools and $2,139,300 for the engagement of contractual service 
personnel for project management and other functional and technical work; and  
(c) $4,947,200 under furniture and equipment, for infrastructure equipment 
necessary for the e-mail archival project and for setting up enterprise servers and 
storage tools. The Advisory Committee notes that the totality of the resources 
proposed are for one-time costs that would no longer be required after full 
implementation of the initiative (see para. 80 above). In addition, the Secretary-
General states that requests for additional funding for future phases of the initiative 
will be submitted as part of the appropriate budget cycles of the United Nations 
Secretariat.  

115. The Advisory Committee notes that implementation of enterprise data 
centres and of disaster recovery and business continuity is an ongoing effort. To 
date, these activities have been undertaken separately for peacekeeping and the 
rest of the Secretariat. The Committee considers that the Secretary-General’s 
proposals respond to the General Assembly’s request for a unified disaster 
recovery and business continuity plan and recommends that the General 
Assembly approve implementation of the Create resilient ICT infrastructure 
initiative. Bearing in mind its observations in paragraph 79 above, the 
Committee recommends that the Secretary-General should be requested to seek 
further opportunities for lowering implementation costs and identify features 
that could be postponed without jeopardizing implementation of the overall 
initiative.  

116. The Advisory Committee also recommends that the Secretary-General be 
requested to provide, in future progress reports, a comprehensive picture of the 
totality of resources dedicated Organization-wide to creating resilient 
infrastructure, including for field missions.

 D. Conclusions and recommendations 
 
 

117. Taking into account its recommendations in paragraphs 89, 99, 107 and 
115 above, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly 
establish 1 D-2 post under section 30 and approve general temporary assistance 
equivalent to 7 P-4 positions to provide additional capacity for the Office of 
Information and Communications Technology in 2012-2013. It further 
recommends that the Assembly also approve total resources in the amount of 
$19,969,450 for the biennium 2012-2013, representing 50 per cent of the 
non-post resources proposed in the amount of $39,938,900 for the 
implementation of activities in connection with the Improve enterprise ICT 
management, Leverage knowledge through ICT, Enhance ICT service delivery 
and Create a resilient ICT infrastructure initiatives.  

118. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in paragraph 153 
of the Secretary-General’s report. Taking into account its recommendations in 
paragraph 117 above, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General 
Assembly: 

 (a) Note that, should the establishment of 1 D-2 post for the biennium 
2012-2013 be approved, the cost of the delayed impact is estimated at $217,200; 

 (b) Note also the proposal for the total resource requirements for the 
biennium 2012-2013, which are estimated at $21,568,450, to be distributed as

appropriation from the support account for peacekeeping operations for 
the financial period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012; 

  b. Future remaining requirements in an estimated amount of 
$6,686,220 would be considered in subsequent support account for 
peacekeeping operations requirements for the financial period from 1 July 
2012 to 30 June 2013; 

  c. Future remaining requirements will be included in subsequent 
support account for peacekeeping operations requirements in an 
estimated amount of $3,376,775 for the financial period from 1 July 2013 
to 30 June 2014; $67,332 for the financial period from 1 July 2014 to  
30 June 2015; and $33,666 for the financial period from 1 July 2015 to

Annex IV 
 

  Initial findings of system-wide study of the United Nations 
organizations that have implemented enterprise resource 
planning systems 
 
 

 • Organizations that had successfully implemented enterprise resource planning 
indicated that support from the highest levels of management was consistently 
demonstrated and manifested to all stakeholders — governing bodies, key 
officers, staff and external parties like vendors, banks, clients or partners. 

 • Many organizations started with a very ambitious plan — scope, timeline, 
availability of staffing resources (skills) — and underestimated financial 
requirements. Many of them had to de-scope during project execution even if 
they planned to implement in phases. 

 • Initially, project management always assumes that it is easy to co-opt business 
owners and their staff and obtain their approval or agreement to the design or 
blueprint or to getting their most knowledgeable staff into the project. Many 
organizations found this more difficult than anticipated. 

 • Those organizations that were upgrading their enterprise resource planning and 
were at the same time implementing other initiatives (human resources reform, 
results-based management, business continuity, ICT strategy, IPSAS) tried to 
integrate them all into one common framework (by having the same steering 
committee, the same project management, etc.). 

 • Business process re-engineering and restructuring is a continuous process and 
does not end when the system goes live. 

 • Timely decision-making was crucial and had to be balanced with appropriate 
adherence to regulations, rules and policies; competing priorities across the 
organization; effective risk management; and reporting lines between senior 
management and project management. 

 • Timelines were ambitious and tight, resulting in either postponement of the 
go-live date or reduction in scope. 

 • Managing the relationship with the vendor or implementing partner was a 
challenge because of the potential impact on costs and the timeline. 

 • The time and effort needed for comprehensive data cleaning were 
underestimated, resulting either in legacy systems being maintained or in 
uncleaned data being migrated to the new system, if it was decided to 
decommission the legacy systems. 

 • The costs of ownership, upgrades and licences continue to be high for 
organizations. 

 • Organizations continue to be challenged as to how to measure the realization 
of benefits or identify and assess key performance indicators. Anecdotal 
evidence and some trends (processing time, production of key reports, 
dashboards) are usually the way benefits are reported. 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 48 
 

 • The more successful examples of implementation involved the active 
engagement of the oversight bodies (internal and external auditors) and 
periodic assessment by outside experts for quality assurance. 

 • The more informed in a timely fashion the governing bodies were, the more 
supportive they were of the projects. 

 • There is a need for the organizations to invest in building up the skills of staff 
with regard to the new enterprise resource planning system. While there is a 
need to recruit outsiders with appropriate expertise, during the duration of the 
project there should be extensive knowledge transfer. 



 A/66/7/Add.1

Annex V 
 

  Composition of the costs to be supported by Umoja 
user departments 
 
 

In connection with the implementation of Umoja, the following activities and their 
associated costs are not included in the Umoja budget. It should be noted that 
analysis of these activities is ongoing and therefore not definitive. 
 

  Data preparation and cleansing 
 

Business expertise and staff resources are required for the identification of the 
current master data in support of the processes that are included in the Umoja 
Foundation scope. Data will require cleansing and enriching in accordance with 
Umoja master data templates which have been created for this purpose. The 
cleansing activity will predominantly take place within the business area that owns 
the legacy system. 

The key master data elements identified in support of the Umoja Foundation phase 
include: 

 • Vendor 

 • Material 

 • Service 

 • Employee 

 • Customer 

 • Equipment 

 • Assets 

 • Real estate 

 • Cost centres 

 • Funds 
 

  Document data 
 

Business expertise and staff resources are required to identify and clean current 
business documents which reference master data. The key documents include: 

 • Purchase orders 

 • Global/local contracts 

 • Sales orders 

 • Lease agreements 

 • Memorandums of understanding 

 • Inventory balances 

 • Accounts receivable/accounts payable balances 

 • Employees 



A/66/7/Add.1  
 

11-60207 50 
 

  Migration, validation and reconciliation 
 

The business areas need to work with the Umoja team in the verification of 
converted/migrated data to ensure accuracy and consistency with expected results 
(especially in the case of migrating outstanding balances). 
 

  Interfaces with critical business systems 
 

There will be a need to develop some interfaces between Umoja and critical 
business systems, especially during the roll-out period. 
 

  System validation 
 

  User acceptance testing requirements 
 

The completion of testing of the Umoja system will require key business user staff 
(who may transition into “coaches”) to validate the Umoja configured business 
processes. 
 

  Infrastructure 
 

In support of the enterprise resources planning business software, the business will 
be required to: 

 • Test/assure system connectivity 

 • Update/upgrade personal computers/laptops to run the enterprise resource 
planning system 

 • Provide access to legacy data for reference purposes/reporting for an 
appropriate period in support of the business requirements 

 • Archive and provide appropriate access to historical/legacy data upon the 
decommissioning of the legacy system 

 

  Implementation and training 
 

  Champion 
 

A nominated and approved organizational leader will be required for the Umoja 
reform initiative for each function/mission/organization to support the preparation 
of data and training, and to resolve issues and facilitate implementation. 
 

  Coach 
 

The coach, locally based and with a part-time role, will be responsible for 
supporting the instructor in classroom training delivery (for local duty stations), 
helping to resolve/address local participant queries, and providing end-user support 
in the post-implementation period. 
 

  Training coordinator 
 

A locally based part-time coordination expert will be responsible for executing 
deployment preparation tasks in collaboration with the central Umoja learning team. 
The training coordinator’s responsibilities include gathering local training 
participant data for role mapping purposes, reviewing local training 



 A/66/7/Add.1
 

51 11-60207 
 

facilities/infrastructure and developing contingency plans where there are 
constraints, planning participant travel and final preparation of training classrooms. 
 

  Provision of training facilities 
 

The deployment of the foundation phase of Umoja will require the identification of 
adequate facilities for training end-users. 
 

  Planning manager 
 

The planning manager will be responsible for working with the Umoja team to 
ensure the overall readiness of the organization/mission for all implementation 
phases. 
 

  Cutover manager/team 
 

The cutover manager/team will be responsible for planning and preparing the 
organization/mission, in coordination with the Umoja readiness team, for the 
migration of the business unit from the legacy application to Umoja.
